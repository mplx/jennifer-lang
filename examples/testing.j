# testing.j - exercises the `testing` library. Defines a
# handful of test methods hitting every failure mode
# (pass, user throw, runtime error, exit inside a test) and
# renders the accumulated results in each of the three shipping
# formats: human text, TAP, and JUnit XML.
#
# Timings vary run to run; the example prints `ms=0` fields by
# overriding the ms via testing.results()'s copy semantics-
# well, not really: the accumulator returns a copy but we can't
# mutate the copy back into anything. So we simply skip printing
# the elapsed millisecond field to keep the golden output
# deterministic.

# the start of a suite makes re-runs (e.g. under `jennifer fmt`
# + rerun) start from a clean slate.
