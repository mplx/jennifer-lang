# Jennifer - Milestones

Development is split into milestones. Each milestone produces a *working*
interpreter that runs a strictly larger subset of the language.

---

## M1 - End-to-end MVP

**Status:** done.

Smallest vertical slice that proves the pipeline (source → tokens →
preprocessed tokens → AST → result):

- Types: `int`, `string`
- `def x as int init 5;`, `$var` references, method defs (zero-arg, top
  level), `import "file.j";`, `use io;`, single-arg `printf`
- Arithmetic `+ - * / %` on ints; comments `#` and `/* */`
- Source-context caret in error messages
- Golden-file integration test and TinyGo build verified

**Exit criterion:** `./jennifer run examples/hello.j` prints `42`.

---

## M2 - Types, constants, scoping, control flow

**Status:** done.

Rounds out the "ordinary" feature set:

- New types `float`, `null`, `bool` with literals `3.14`, `null`, `true`,
  `false`
- Uninitialized `def x as T;` gives `T`'s zero value
- `def const NAME as TYPE init VALUE;` (reassignment is an error)
- Nested block scoping; inner scopes cannot redeclare visible names
- Assignment statement `$x = EXPR;`
- Comparison `< > <= >= ==`, `+` for string concat, `int`↔`float`
  promotion
- Escape parsing in `'...'` strings (previously only `"..."`)
- Control flow: `if`/`elseif`/`else`, `while`, `for`, all requiring
  `bool` conditions (no implicit truthiness)

---

## M3 - Methods with parameters and return values

**Status:** done.

- `func name(a as int, b as string) { ... }` with typed parameters,
  by-value argument passing, call-site arity + type checks
- `return;` and `return EXPR;`; recursion works
- `sprintf` and format verbs `%d %f %s %t %v %%` for both `printf` and
  `sprintf`
- The omnibus `stdlib` retired in favor of topic-based libraries; `io`
  is the first.

---

## M4 - Polish & ergonomics

**Status:** done.

- Logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` (word-based, short-circuit)
- Unary minus
- Python-3 division: `/` always returns `float`; new `div` keyword for 
  floor division (`//` is taken by line comments)
- Floats always display with a decimal (`5.0`, not `5`) so the type
  stays visible
- New libraries (all `use`-gated): [`convert`](libraries/convert.md),
  [`math`](libraries/math.md), [`strings`](libraries/strings.md)
- Interpreter gained `RegisterConst` so libraries can expose constants
  (`PI`, `E`).

---

## M5 - Interpreter improvements

**Status:** done.

- **Cross-file error sources** - errors raised inside an imported `.j`
  display the line from the imported file. See
  [technical/interpreter.md > Errors and positions](technical/interpreter.md#errors-and-positions-cross-file).
- **REPL** - `jennifer repl`, persistent globals/methods/imports across
  inputs, multi-line input via brace balancing, expression results
  printed. See [technical/cli.md > REPL](technical/cli.md#repl-cmdjenniferreplgo).
- **REPL line editor** - cursor keys, Home/End, word motions, Ctrl+W /
  Ctrl+U / Ctrl+K, in-memory history (Up/Down), Ctrl+C cancel. Non-TTY
  stdin falls back to plain line reading. See
  [technical/cli.md > Line editor](technical/cli.md#line-editor-cmdjenniferlineeditgo-cmdjenniferhistorygo).
- **Auto-loaded `core` library** - new library kind, pre-imported at
  startup; writing `use core;` is a runtime error. Contents:
  `JENNIFER_VERSION` (a `git describe`-derived build-version constant)
  and `len` (polymorphic over strings now; lists/maps in M6). `len`
  moved here from `strings`. See [libraries/core.md](libraries/core.md)
  and [technical/cli.md > Version injection](technical/cli.md#version-injection).
- **Formatter** - `jennifer fmt` re-emits canonical source per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md). Token-level walker so file imports and
  user-written parentheses survive. See
  [technical/cli.md > Formatter](technical/cli.md#formatter-cmdjenniferfmtgo).
- **Inspection subcommands** - `jennifer tokens <file>` dumps the lexer
  output; `jennifer ast <file>` dumps the preprocessed AST as JSON.
  See [technical/cli.md > Inspection](technical/cli.md#inspection-tokens-and-ast).
- **Underscore-in-constants** - constant names became `[A-Z]+(_[A-Z]+)*`,
  enabling `MAX_RETRIES` and the `JENNIFER_VERSION` rename. See
  [technical/lexer.md > Identifier rule](technical/lexer.md#identifier-rule).
- **Documentation overhaul** - `docs/technical.md` split into
  `docs/technical/<topic>.md`; `docs/lib_*.md` moved to
  `docs/libraries/`; new `docs/user-guide/style-guide.md`.

---

## M6 - Lists and maps

**Status:** done.

Two new compound types - `list` and `map` - plus the strings library
functions deferred until compound types existed.

- **Syntax**: `def xs as list of int init [1, 2, 3];`,
  `def m as map of string to int init {"a": 1};`. Index read/write
  `$xs[i]`, `$m["k"]`, chains `$g[i][j]`. Iteration via
  `for (def x in $coll) { ... }` (new keyword `in`). New tokens
  `[ ] :` and keywords `list`, `map`, `of`, `to`, `in`.
- **Semantics**: value-typed (copy on assignment and on
  function-parameter binding; no aliasing); `const` is deep
  (`$NUMS[0] = ...` is a runtime error if `NUMS` is `const`);
  out-of-bounds list reads/writes and missing map keys are positioned
  runtime errors; map iteration is insertion-order deterministic.
- **Type system**: `parser.Type` became a recursive struct
  (`Element`, `KeyType`, `ValType` `*Type` slots), so nesting like
  `list of list of int` falls out without depth cap. 3+ levels is a
  documented code smell.
- **Stdlib**: `core.len` extended to lists and maps; `core.has(m, key)`
  for membership tests; `strings.split`, `strings.chars`,
  `strings.join` finished.
- **Tooling**: formatter handles `[...]` / `{...}` per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md) (no inner padding, space after `,`/`:`,
  block-vs-map disambiguation via a small brace stack); AST JSON
  emitter handles `ListLit`, `MapLit`, `IndexExpr`, `IndexAssignStmt`,
  `ForEachStmt`.

See [user-guide/types-and-values.md > Lists and maps](user-guide/types-and-values.md#lists-and-maps) for
the user-facing tour, and
[technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) /
[technical/interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md) for the
implementation contract.

## M7 - printf modifiers, stdin input, comment/division swap

**Status:** done.

A breaking syntax change to free up `//` for integer division and to
allow shebangs, the long-promised format-verb modifier system, and
the first stdin-reading builtins.

- **Comments and integer division** (**BREAKING**). Line comments
  moved from `//` to `#`, freeing `//` for floor division (Python 3
  shape). `div` keyword removed. A Jennifer file can now begin with
  `#!/usr/bin/env -S jennifer run`.
- **`(s)printf` format-verb modifiers.** Each format verb except `%v`
  accepts a pipe-separated, order-independent flag list:
  `%verb[|key=value]*`. Modifiers shape *presentation* only - data
  transformations (`case=upper` on strings, markdown rendering, etc.)
  are explicitly out of scope; libraries do that work. Verbs gained:
  `pad`/`max`/`align`/`mode` (`%s`); `pad`/`fill`/`align`/`base`/
  `sign`/`group`/`sep` (`%d`); `prec`/`trim`/`sci`/`pad`/`align`/
  `sign` (`%f`); `case` (`%t`); shared `null=empty|null|literal(...)`
  across all four typed verbs. `%v` deliberately takes none.
- **Format-string breaking change.** `|` immediately after a verb
  now starts a modifier list. Pre-M7 strings with `|` as a literal
  separator (`"%d|%d"`) need either a different separator or the
  `||` escape (parallels `%%`).
- **`io` stdin input.** New builtins `readLine()`,
  `readLine(prompt)`, `eof()` - one-line-at-a-time reads with an
  explicit EOF predicate (`while (not eof()) { ... }`). Refuses
  inside the REPL since the line editor owns stdin.
- **Internals.** Builtin signature changed from
  `func(out io.Writer, args)` to `func(ctx BuiltinCtx, args)` so
  stdin and the REPL flag are plumbed symmetrically with stdout.
  Mechanical refactor across the ~30 existing builtins.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - full modifier and input reference.
- [technical/lexer.md](technical/lexer.md) and
  [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - the comment / division
  syntax change.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - what the modifier
  system deliberately doesn't do (data transformations, `%a`
  aggregate, `null=sql`/`null=skip`) and why the literal-pipe
  lookahead alternative was turned down.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Builtins and libraries](technical/interpreter.md#builtins-and-libraries) - the `BuiltinCtx` signature.

---

## M8 - System library namespacing

**Status:** done.

A hybrid namespace model so domain libraries can ship without
polluting the bare-name pool, plus the first real namespaced
library (`os`) so the machinery has a non-synthetic exercise.

- **Hybrid model.** Essential libraries (`io`, `convert`, `math`,
  `strings`, auto-loaded `core`) stay flat - their builtins are
  bare names. Domain libraries register through a new namespaced
  API (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) and are
  addressed by `prefix.name(...)` / `prefix.NAME`. The library's
  name doubles as the namespace prefix.
- **Qualified calls and constants.** New AST nodes
  `QualifiedCallExpr` and `QualifiedConstRefExpr`; parsed as
  `IDENT "." IDENT` (then `(` decides). Lookup is keyed by
  `(namespace, name)` and gated by `use lib;`.
- **`use NAME as ALIAS;` aliasing.** Optional `as` clause on
  `use`. Rename-not-addition: after `use bio as b;` only `b.`
  resolves, `bio.foo()` errors with a "did you mean `b`?" hint;
  the canonical name `bio` is freed for ordinary identifier use.
  Matches Python's `import foo as bar`. Aliasing is rejected for
  flat libraries (`use math as m;` errors as meaningless).
- **Namespace prefix is a reserved identifier.** After bare
  `use bio;`, `func bio() {}` errors with `shadows imported
  namespace 'bio'`. After `use bio as b;`, only `b` is reserved.
- **No migration.** The change is purely additive; all five flat
  essentials continue to work unchanged.
- **Demo library `os` (minimal slice).** First namespaced
  library: `os.platform() -> string`, `os.getEnv(name) -> string`,
  `os.JENNIFER_LF`, `os.JENNIFER_OS`. Two functions plus two
  constants - enough to exercise namespaced zero-arg calls,
  namespaced calls with arguments, namespaced constants, and
  aliasing end-to-end. Expands in M15.1.

See:
- [libraries/os.md](libraries/os.md) - the shipping demo library.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - flat vs namespaced
  policy and the rule for library authors.
- [user-guide/imports.md > Namespaced libraries and aliasing](user-guide/imports.md#namespaced-libraries-and-aliasing) -
  user-facing reference for `use NAME [as ALIAS];` and qualified
  calls.
- [user-guide/style-guide.md > Namespaced calls](user-guide/style-guide.md#namespaced-calls) -
  spacing convention around `.`.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF for
  `qualifiedCall` / `qualifiedConstRef` and the `use ... as ...`
  shape; AST table entries for the new nodes.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Namespaced libraries (M8)](technical/interpreter.md#namespaced-libraries-m8) -
  registration API, `nsPrefixes` / `nsAliasedAway` resolution
  tables, no-shadowing rule for namespace prefixes.

---

## M9 - Collection operations

**Status:** done.

Two new namespaced libraries cover the M6-deferred list/map
manipulation helpers, a small append sugar shortens the common
write pattern, and two follow-on breaking changes tidy up the
flat-vs-namespaced split.

- **`lists` library** (`use lists;`, namespaced). `lists.push`,
  `lists.pop`, `lists.first`, `lists.last`, `lists.head`,
  `lists.tail`, `lists.reverse`, `lists.sort`, `lists.contains`,
  `lists.concat`, `lists.slice`. Non-mutating - every function
  returns a new list. `sort` accepts numeric, string, or bool
  elements (mixed int/float promotes; other mixes error);
  comparator-based sort is deferred until methods are first-class.
- **`maps` library** (`use maps;`, namespaced). `maps.keys`,
  `maps.values`, `maps.has`, `maps.delete`, `maps.merge`. Same
  shape. `maps.delete` of a missing key errors (strict at
  boundaries, matching `$m[missing]`); `maps.merge` layers the
  second arg over the first.
- **Sugar: `$xs[] = item;`** - write-only target meaning "just past
  the end of the list". Equivalent to
  `$xs = lists.push($xs, item);`. Reads of `$xs[]` and chained
  forms (`$xs[0][]`) are parse errors; non-list targets error at
  runtime. New AST node `AppendStmt`.
- **BREAKING:** `has()` moved from `core` to `maps` as
  `maps.has(m, key)`. Bare `has(...)` callers now need
  `use maps;` and the qualified form. `has` was the only
  non-polymorphic name in core; `len` stays because it genuinely
  spans string / list / map.
- **BREAKING:** `strings` library moved from flat to namespaced.
  `upper(s)` → `strings.upper(s)`, `contains(s, sub)` →
  `strings.contains(s, sub)`, etc. across all 15 functions.
  `use strings;` itself is unchanged. The M8 library-author rule
  named exactly these collision-prone verbs (`contains`, `split`,
  `replace`, `join`); acting on it now keeps callers off the wrong
  shape before more libraries arrive. After M9 the remaining flat
  libraries are `io`, `convert`, `math`, and auto-loaded `core`.

See:
- [libraries/lists.md](libraries/lists.md) /
  [libraries/maps.md](libraries/maps.md) - function reference for
  each new library.
- [libraries/strings.md](libraries/strings.md) - now namespaced
  (M9 migration note at top).
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - updated flat-vs-namespaced
  catalog and the library-author rule.
- [user-guide/imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) and

  user-facing reference.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF and AST entry
  for `AppendStmt`.

---

The next phase splits into four arcs after two architectural
prerequisites: M10 lands the namespace-first library architecture
that the rest of the standard library will be built on; Phase A
(M11-M13) finishes the language so libraries have something to
stand on; M14 closes the lexer-side gap (`fmt` losing comments
and shebangs) so the first wave of struct-using libraries can
ship with doc-comments intact; Phase B (M15.x) ships the
foundational libraries that every Jennifer program needs,
finishing with **M15.5 - the first public release** (CI, prebuilt
binaries, .deb / pacman / AUR packaging); Phase C (M16.x) ships
I/O libraries on top of the now-released foundation; Phase D
(M17-M20) ships the higher-level ecosystem (Jennifer-coded
libraries, the module system that unblocks them, crypto, a
server). Phase E (WASM and specialised domains) is the long
horizon.

The library milestones use sub-numbering (M15.1, M15.2, ...) so
each library ships and is reviewed independently. This is the
first time we use sub-milestones; the practice is justified
because each library is small enough to land in a single sitting
once the language foundation is in place.

---

## M10 - Namespace-first library architecture

**Status:** done.

A pre-language-completion API-shape correction: every library is
now namespaced, with bare-name globals reserved as a narrow
`core`-only exception. Small implementation surface, large API
shape; pre-1.0 is the window for this kind of change.

- **BREAKING:** `io`, `math`, `convert` migrate to
  namespaced-only. `printf(x)` → `io.printf(x)`,
  `sqrt(x)` → `math.sqrt(x)`, etc. The "io is special, keep
  it flat" alternative was considered and rejected at kickoff
  to keep a uniform "every call carries its library name"
  rule. `strings`, `lists`, `maps`, `os` were already
  namespaced (M9/M8).
- **BREAKING:** `convert`'s four conversion callees are renamed
  to `convert.toInt`, `convert.toFloat`, `convert.toString`,
  `convert.toBool` so they don't collide with the type
  keywords (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`); `convert.typeOf`
  keeps its name. The `to`-prefix also reads as English
  ("convert to int") at the call site.
- **BREAKING:** file-splice keyword `import` → `include`.
  `include "x.j";` is the textual splice; the `import`
  keyword is reserved for the M17 module system and produces
  a migration-hint error today. Mixing-mistake diagnostics
  updated.
- **BREAKING for embedders:** registration API renamed.
  `Register` / `RegisterConst` → `RegisterGlobal` /
  `RegisterGlobalConst`, making their role explicit ("expose
  this name globally"). The namespaced API
  (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) keeps
  its name and is the recommended default. Per-library
  storage (`globalFnsByLib`, `globalConstsByLib`) so two
  libraries with the same global name can no longer silently
  overwrite each other at Install time; the resolution map
  is populated by `processImports` when a library activates.
- **`math` absorbs the planned non-crypto random helpers**:
  `math.rand()`, `math.randInt(lo, hi)`, `math.randSeed(n)`.
  Three functions don't justify their own library under the
  new threshold (next bullet); pseudo-random fits `math`'s
  pure-numeric charter. The crypto-grade variant still ships
  in M19 `crypto`. The originally planned M14.2 `random`
  library is removed.
- **`core` is the only library publishing bare-name globals.**
  `len` and `JENNIFER_VERSION` only - no `core.len` /
  `core.JENNIFER_VERSION` qualified form, because shipping the
  same name two ways violates stance #1. `core` is the
  auto-loaded escape hatch, and its asymmetric exposure is
  the whole point.
- **Three globals-publishing rules in `processImports`**, all
  forward-looking (inert today since `core` is the only
  globals-publishing library and can't be `use`d):
  1. Duplicate `use` of a globals-publishing library is
     rejected (`library 'X' already in scope`); REPL no-ops a
     repeat.
  2. `use X as Y;` where `X` has globals but no namespaced
     names is rejected as meaningless.
  3. Two active libraries publishing the same global name are
     rejected at the second `use`
     (`library "B" collides with already-active library "A"
     on global "VER"`). The pre-M10 flat-only-alias-meaningless
     check is removed for the general case but kept as rule 2.
- **Library-author guidance updated.** The
  `docs/libraries/index.md` "flat vs namespaced" framing is
  retired; the new policy is "every library is namespaced;
  only `core` ships globals via `RegisterGlobal`." The
  "deserves its own library" threshold is raised from M8's
  "3+" to **"5+ functions or constants"**: anything smaller
  folds into the most-related existing library. The non-crypto
  random helpers (3 functions) are the first case the new rule
  caught.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md),
  [libraries/math.md](libraries/math.md),
  [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md),
  [libraries/core.md](libraries/core.md) - migrated library
  references.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - retired
  flat-vs-namespaced framing; new library-author policy and
  5+ threshold.
- [user-guide/imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) - `use` and
  `include` keyword reference; namespaced-call and aliasing
  rules.
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `convert.toInt` / `convert.toFloat` example placement in the
  "explicit conversions" section.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - "Methods
  on structs" (M14.3 trigger; recorded here in M10's wake
  because M10's review touched the same call-shape question)
  and other related rejected alternatives.

No new language features land here - that's M11.

---

**Phase A: language completion (M11-M13).** These three milestones
close the biggest daily-use gaps and add the foundational types every
later library needs.

## M11 - Control-flow completion

**Status:** done.

Closes the biggest daily-use gap in the language and rounds out the
printf modifier table at the same time. Five new keywords (`break`,
`continue`, `repeat`, `until`, `exit`) and two new printf features.

- **`break;` / `continue;`** in every loop kind
  (`while`/`for`/`for-each`/`repeat`). Innermost loop only; misuse
  outside a loop or across a method-call boundary is a positioned
  runtime error. `continue` in C-style `for` still runs the step
  before re-checking the condition (matches C/Go).
- **`repeat { } until (cond);`** post-test loop. New keywords
  `repeat` and `until`; `do { } while ...` considered and rejected
  because the inverted condition is the whole point of switching
  to `until`.
- **`exit;` / `exit EXPR;`** terminate the whole program (exit code 0
  / EXPR-as-int). Distinct from `return` (method-scoped): skips every
  caller frame and remaining top-level statement. Implemented as an
  `ExitSignal` sentinel error the CLI translates into the OS exit
  status.
- **Bundled: printf `%s|align=center`** rounds out the align set.
  Rejected on every other typed verb (centred numbers break columnar
  output).
- **Bundled: printf `%a` aggregate verb** for lists and maps
  (deferred from M7; unblocked by M6 + M9). Modifiers: `sep`, `kv`,
  `open`, `close`, `depth=N`, `null=skip`. The modifier-list parser
  was extended with a `"..."` quoted-value form (`%a|sep=", "`) so
  values can contain spaces / reserved characters; standard
  `\n \r \t \\ \"` escapes.
- **Post-dot name relaxation.** Reserved words read as identifiers in
  the name slot of a qualified call (`strings.repeat`,
  `lists.break` if anyone wrote one), preserving the `strings.repeat`
  library function after `repeat` was reserved as a loop keyword.

See:
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  `repeat`/`until`, `break`/`continue` scope rules, `exit` vs
  `return`.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `%a` modifier table,
  `%s|align=center` example, quoted modifier values.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - `%a|json=*` /
  `%a|xml=*` / `%a|yaml=*` (serialisation modifiers stayed rejected
  even after `%a` itself shipped) and the
  `do { } while` shape for the post-test loop.

## M12 - Bytes and bit operators

**Status:** done.

Adds the buffer-shaped primitive and the bit-twiddling vocabulary
the standard library needs for hashing, encoding, crypto, and
network code in later milestones.

- **New primitive type `bytes`** - mutable byte sequence; value
  semantics on assignment / parameter binding; deep-const. Reads
  yield `int` in `[0, 255]`; writes accept the same range and
  reject anything else. Append via the existing M9 `$b[] = byte;`
  sugar. `len($b)` returns the byte count.
- **New `convert.bytesFromString(s, codec)` and
  `convert.stringFromBytes(b, codec)`** - bytes ↔ string codecs.
  Only `"utf-8"` today (further codecs ship in M15.4 `encoding`).
  Invalid UTF-8 input is an error - no silent replacement
  characters.
- **Bit operators on `int`**: `& | ^ ~ << >>`. Python-style
  precedence (comparison < `|` < `^` < `&` < shifts < `+ -`),
  so `$x & 0xff == 0` parses as `($x & 0xff) == 0`. `~` is
  bitwise NOT. Shifts are arithmetic; negative count rejected;
  count >= 64 saturates to 0 / -1. `^` ships as a primitive
  operator (CPU primitive with unique algebraic properties -
  same justification `-` has against being composable from `+`
  and unary `-`).
- **Non-decimal integer literals**: hex `0xff`, octal `0o755`,
  binary `0b1010_0110`. `_` accepted between digits in any base
  (including decimal `1_000_000` and float mantissas). Never
  adjacent to the prefix or another `_`. Lexer-only change.
- **Resolves M7-deferred stdin builtins**:
  `io.readBytes(n) -> bytes` (exact n; partial at EOF then
  `io.eof()` becomes true) and `io.readChars(n) -> string`
  (n runes, UTF-8 decoded). Both compose with M7's `io.eof()`
  unchanged.

See:
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `bytes` type, value semantics, index-write rules.
- [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md) - codec functions,
  UTF-8 strictness.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `io.readBytes`,
  `io.readChars`.
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  bit-operator precedence table.
- [user-guide/syntax.md](user-guide/syntax.md) - non-decimal
  literals + digit separator.

## M13 - Structs and catchable errors

**Status:** done.

The composite-data milestone, batched into two sub-milestones in
dependency order: M13.1 ships the struct mechanism, M13.2 ships
the error-handling design that uses it. Together they unblock
every library that wants composite returns and give the language
a recoverable-error story.

## M13.1 - Structs / records

**Status:** done.

- `def struct Name { field as type, ... };` at top level
  (hoisted before the first statement; duplicate names error in
  `Run`, silently redefine in the REPL).
- Literals `Name{ field: expr, ... }` with every field required;
  `def x as Name;` (no init) zero-fills, recursing through
  nested struct fields.
- Field read `$p.field`, write `$p.field = ...;`. Lvalue chains
  mix `[index]` and `.field` freely (`$L.from.x = 5;`,
  `$bag.items[0] = 99;`); index-assign and field-assign share
  one walker.
- Value semantics like lists/maps; `const` deep at any depth.
- Strict at boundaries: unknown struct type, missing / unknown
  field at literal, field-type mismatch on write, field access
  on a non-struct value are all positioned errors.

See:
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md#structs) -
  language angle.
- [technical/interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md#structs-m131) -
  runtime details (`KindStruct`, hoisting, unified lvalue walker).
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - `structDef`,
  `structLit`, `fieldAssign`, mixed-tail lvalues.
- `examples/structs.j` standalone; `examples/showcase.j`
  `=== M13.1 structs ===` section.

## M13.2 - `try` / `catch` / `throw`

**Status:** done.

Catchable errors. New keywords `try`, `catch`, `throw`. Depends
on M13.1 because the canonical error value is a struct.

- `try { body } catch (NAME) { handler }` runs the body and, on
  a catchable error, binds the thrown value to `$NAME` in a
  fresh per-handler scope.
- `throw EXPR;` raises any value; convention is the auto-hoisted
  `Error{kind, message, file, line, col}` struct.
- Runtime errors (out-of-bounds, missing key, type mismatch,
  etc.) are wrapped into the canonical `Error` shape on entry
  to the catch (`kind` defaults to `"runtime"` until sites
  opt in to specific tags); user code catches both kinds
  uniformly. `throw $err;` inside a catch re-raises to the
  enclosing `try`.
- **Not** catchable: `exit` (program-level escape, propagates
  through `try`); `return` / `break` / `continue` (control
  flow, flow through `try` unchanged).
- No `finally` and no typed catch in v1.
- Internals: `ErrorSignal` sentinel parallels `ExitSignal`;
  `runtimeError.Kind` field threads the symbolic tag; user code
  may not redefine the auto-hoisted `Error` struct.

## M14 - Lexer comment + blank-line preservation

**Status:** done.

A side-channel for comments and blank lines so `jennifer fmt`
stops dropping the file's documentation. Closes the two
M5-deferred items (`fmt drops comments`, `fmt drops blank
lines`) together because the same machinery covers both. No
language change - the runtime still never sees comments.

- **Lexer emits trivia tokens** (`TOKEN_COMMENT_LINE`,
  `TOKEN_COMMENT_BLOCK`, `TOKEN_COMMENT_SHEBANG`,
  `TOKEN_BLANK_LINE`). The shebang `#!` on line 1 col 1 is its
  own kind so the formatter can re-emit it verbatim at the file
  head. Runs of blank lines collapse to one token (matches the
  style rule "never more than one consecutive blank line").
- **Preprocessor and parser strip trivia at entry** so include /
  use / import recognition and grammar productions are
  unaffected.
- **`jennifer fmt` walks the raw lexer stream** and emits trivia
  inline via a dedicated `emitTrivia` path that doesn't touch
  the surrounding state machine (unary-vs-binary tracking, brace
  classification, etc. continue to see the most recent regular
  token). Leading comments land on their own line at the
  current indent; trailing same-line comments stay on the same
  line; blank lines re-emit between blocks. Comments inside an
  expression (`printf(/* note */ $x)`) are preserved by-position
  rather than attached to any particular subexpression.
- **Block comments nest** via a depth counter (increment on
  `/*`, decrement on `*/`, exit at depth 0). Unterminated nested
  comments still error at the outermost `/*` so the message
  points at where the user meant to start. Lets the common
  "comment out a chunk of code that already contains a block
  comment" case work without `#` rewrites.
- **Token-level over AST-level.** The original spec proposed
  AST-attached `LeadingComments` / `TrailingComment` slots and a
  `jennifer ast --with-comments` flag. The implementation chose
  the token-level path instead - simpler, consistent with the
  existing `fmt` architecture, and sufficient for the goal. The
  AST-attachment slots and the `--with-comments` flag were
  dropped from scope; if a future use case needs structured
  per-statement comment attachment (e.g. a doc generator), it
  can land then.
- **Style guide updates.** The two "Limitations" bullets in
  `style-guide.md` (comments dropped, blank lines not
  preserved) are removed. The "Block comments don't nest" line
  is updated to "Block comments nest." The "Source file
  conventions" section notes that shebang, header comments,
  and inline `# why` notes all survive a `fmt` round-trip.

Landed between M13.2 (try/catch) and the M15.x library batch so
the first wave of struct-using libraries can ship with
doc-comments that `fmt` preserves.

---

**Phase B: foundational libraries (M15.x).** Small, frequently-used
libraries grouped under M15 with sub-numbering. Most M15.x slots
ship a new library independently; the leading M15.0 slot is the
"wrap-up of existing libraries" - small additions to the
M8 / M9 / M10 libraries that depend on something the language
gained in M10-M14 (random helpers, structs, bytes, etc.). Each
extension picks the existing library that's already its natural
home rather than getting a tiny library of its own.

## M15.0 - existing-library extensions

Small additions to the M8 / M9 / M10 libraries that depend on
features the language picked up after those libraries shipped.

- **`lists.shuffle(xs) -> list`** - Durstenfeld's variant of the
  Fisher-Yates shuffle. Returns a new list with the elements in
  a uniformly random order; non-mutating, matching
  `lists.sort` / `lists.reverse` / every other helper in the
  library. Algorithm walks the elements from index `n-1` down to
  `1`; for each `i`, pick a random `j` in `[0, i]` and swap; the
  walk is O(n) and the distribution is uniform across the `n!`
  permutations. Empty and single-element inputs are returned
  unchanged (still copied, per the non-mutating convention).
  Determinism: respects `math.randSeed(n)` from M10 - calling
  `math.randSeed(N); lists.shuffle($xs)` twice in the same run
  yields the same permutation, useful for reproducibility in
  tests and reruns. Dependency: `math.rand*` (M10, shipped).
- **`lists.range(...) -> list of int`** - allocate a list of
  consecutive integers. Arity-dispatched, same shape as
  `lists.slice` which already overloads on arity:
  - `lists.range(end)` → `[0, 1, ..., end-1]`
  - `lists.range(start, end)` → `[start, start+1, ..., end-1]`
  - `lists.range(start, end, step)` → walks by `step`; positive
    `step` requires `start <= end` and stops at the largest
    value `< end`; negative `step` requires `start >= end` and
    stops at the smallest value `> end`.

  **End is exclusive** to match `lists.slice` (M9) and
  `strings.substring` (M9). `len(lists.range(a, b)) == b - a`
  when `a <= b` and step is 1. Step must be non-zero (positional
  error). An empty result is returned for ranges that would
  produce no values rather than treated as an error
  (`lists.range(5, 5)` → `[]`).

  Ships as a library function rather than a `[1..n]` syntax
  operator on Stance #1 grounds - see
  [technical/rejected.md > Range literal syntax](../technical/rejected.md#range-literal-syntax-19).

Further extensions can land here as the language gains features
that unblock library additions (e.g. a `maps.invert` once it has
a clear use case; a `strings.repeat` already exists so it stays
put).

## M15.1 - `os`

Expands the M8 demo slice (`os.platform()`, `os.getEnv(name)`,
`os.JENNIFER_LF`, `os.JENNIFER_OS` already ship there). One large
update covering process metadata, the `JENNIFER_*` constant set,
and the external-program execution surface. Depends on M13.1
(structs) for the result and handle types.

**Process metadata.**

- `os.args -> list of string` - command-line arguments passed to
  the running program (index 0 is the program name, by convention).
- Constants `os.JENNIFER_BUILD`, `os.JENNIFER_PLATFORM`,
  `os.JENNIFER_ARCHITECTURE` round out the `JENNIFER_*` set
  introduced in M8.

Process exit stays on the language statement `exit EXPR;` (M11),
not in `os` - see
[rejected.md > `os.exit(n)`](technical/rejected.md#osexitn).

**External-program execution.**

Two result structs, one process handle struct, four functions:

- `def struct os.Result { exitCode as int, stdout as string,
  stderr as string };` - what a command produced.
- `def struct os.Process { ... };` - opaque handle for an async
  child. Field shape (pid, internal state) settled at start of
  M15.1; users interact through the function API below, not the
  fields directly.

**Argument-list form, no shell.** Every variant takes the command
as a `list of string` (argv-style: program name plus arguments).
This avoids the shell-injection footguns of a single concatenated
command string. If a user genuinely wants shell parsing they pass
`["sh", "-c", $cmd]` explicitly - making the shell hop visible at
the call site.

- `os.run(argv) -> os.Result` - **blocking**. Runs the command to
  completion, captures stdout and stderr into the result, returns
  the exit code. The interpreter's stdin is not passed through
  (deferred; explicit stdin variant lands in a later sub-milestone
  if demand surfaces).
- `os.spawn(argv) -> os.Process` - **non-blocking**. Starts the
  command and returns immediately with a handle. Streams are
  buffered internally; the caller drains them through
  `os.wait` / `os.poll`.
- `os.wait(p as os.Process) -> os.Result` - block until `$p`
  terminates, then return its `os.Result`. Subsequent waits on
  the same handle return the same result (idempotent).
- `os.poll(p as os.Process) -> bool` - `true` once `$p` has
  terminated and an `os.wait` will return immediately. Pure
  predicate, no side effects.
- `os.kill(p as os.Process)` - request termination of `$p`
  (SIGTERM on POSIX). A subsequent `os.wait` returns the result
  the OS reports for a terminated child. Signal variants beyond
  SIGTERM are out of scope for M15.1.

Errors at the boundary (program not found, not executable,
permission denied, fork/exec failure) are positioned runtime
errors at the `os.run` / `os.spawn` site, matching the
"strict at boundaries" stance. Non-zero exit codes are **not**
errors - they're values in `os.Result.exitCode`; the caller
decides whether to branch on them.

## M15.2 - `time`

One library covering both date and time concerns through a single
zone-aware instant type, plus a separate span type for differences.
Splits into two sub-milestones because formatting and parsing carry
their own design surface (timezone names, locale-shaped output);
the core type plus arithmetic ships first so other M15 / M16
libraries can rely on it.

**One-type rationale.** Splitting `date` / `time` / `datetime`
(the Java pre-`java.time`, Python `datetime`/`date`/`time`,
JavaScript-`Date`-plus-libraries problem) front-loads
conversion code into every library that crosses the boundary.
Every program that needs a calendar date eventually needs a
time-of-day, and vice versa. Granularity (date-only,
time-of-day-only) is a property of formatting and parsing, not
of the value's type.

Unix timestamps are **not** a separate type; they're a
constructor (`time.fromUnix(n)`) and accessor
(`$t.unix() -> int`). Same shape for ISO 8601 strings and any
other wire format added in M15.2.2.

### M15.2.1 - core type, arithmetic, Unix

- `def struct time.Time { ... };` - opaque struct representing
  an instant on the wall-clock timeline with nanosecond
  precision and zone awareness. Fields are private API; users
  interact through the function set below. (Re-using the M13.1
  struct machinery; `time.Time` is just a struct that the
  library happens to ship and on which the library defines
  operators.)
- `def struct time.Duration { ... };` - a span. Subtracting two
  `time.Time` produces a `Duration`; adding a `Duration` to a
  `Time` produces a `Time`.
- `time.now() -> time.Time` - current instant in the local
  zone.
- `time.utc() -> time.Time` - current instant in UTC.
- `time.fromUnix(seconds as int) -> time.Time`,
  `time.fromUnixMillis(ms as int) -> time.Time`,
  `time.fromUnixNanos(ns as int) -> time.Time` - constructors
  from common Unix integer encodings.
- Accessors as plain functions:
  `time.unix($t) -> int`, `time.unixMillis($t) -> int`,
  `time.unixNanos($t) -> int`; calendar accessors
  `time.year($t)`, `time.month($t)`, `time.day($t)`,
  `time.hour($t)`, `time.minute($t)`, `time.second($t)`,
  `time.nanosecond($t)`, `time.weekday($t)`. (Jennifer has no
  methods on structs - see
  [rejected.md > Methods on structs](technical/rejected.md#methods-on-structs)
  for why; every library exposes accessors as
  `lib.name(struct)`, not `$struct.name()`.)
- Arithmetic: `time.add($t, $d) -> time.Time`,
  `time.sub($t1, $t2) -> time.Duration`,
  `time.before($a, $b) -> bool`, `time.after($a, $b) -> bool`,
  `time.equal($a, $b) -> bool`. Operator overloading is not
  in the language; these are explicit function calls.
- Duration constructors mirror the `fromUnix` shape so
  constructor and accessor never collide:
  `time.fromSeconds(n)`, `time.fromMilliseconds(n)`,
  `time.fromMinutes(n)`, `time.fromHours(n)`. Duration
  accessors return the span as the requested unit:
  `time.seconds($d)`, `time.milliseconds($d)`,
  `time.minutes($d)`, `time.hours($d)`.

### M15.2.2 - formatting, parsing, timezones

- `time.format($t, layout as string) -> string` - layout
  language settled at the start of M15.2.2 (`strftime`-style
  vs Go's reference-time style; the former wins on
  familiarity, the latter on copy-paste reliability).
- `time.parse(s as string, layout as string) -> time.Time` -
  strict parse, positioned error on mismatch.
- `time.iso(t)` / `time.fromIso(s)` - ISO 8601 round-trip;
  the common case shouldn't need a format string.
- Timezone handling:
  `time.zone(name as string) -> time.Zone`,
  `time.inZone($t, $z) -> time.Time`. Zone name uses the
  IANA database (`"Europe/Vienna"`, `"America/Los_Angeles"`).
  TinyGo footprint of the tz database evaluated honestly
  before commitment; if too heavy, ship only fixed offsets
  in M15.2.2 and defer IANA loading until embedding decisions
  settle.

## M15.3 - `hash` and `crc`

Common digests over `bytes` (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, CRC32, CRC64).
Pure compute, no external dependencies. Crypto-relevant primitives
that don't require key material live here; key-based crypto goes
in M19.

**One-shot API.** Whole-input digests for the common case where
the data fits in memory:

- `hash.md5($bytes) -> bytes`, `hash.sha1($bytes) -> bytes`,
  `hash.sha256($bytes) -> bytes`, `crc.crc32($bytes) -> bytes`,
  `crc.crc64($bytes) -> bytes`. Output is the raw digest as
  `bytes` - users hex/base64-encode it through `encoding` when
  they need a string representation.

**Streaming API.** For inputs larger than memory (files,
streams), one primitive per algorithm:

- `hash.streamMd5() -> hash.Stream`, `hash.streamSha256()`,
  `crc.streamCrc32()`, ... - each returns an opaque stream
  handle (struct from M13.1).
- `hash.update($stream, $bytes)` feeds the next chunk.
- `hash.finalize($stream) -> bytes` returns the final digest;
  the stream is consumed and further `update` calls error.
- File hashing is the documented three-line idiom: open the
  file via `fs`, read chunks, feed to a stream, finalize. The
  `hash` library does *not* ship a `hash.md5File(path)`
  convenience - that would pull `fs` into the dependency
  graph and create a parallel API for what the streaming
  primitive already does.

**No convenience wrappers** (`hash.md5String($s)`,
`hash.md5Hex($bytes)`, ...). Stance #1 "one way per thing":
strings go through `convert.bytesFromString` first, hex
encoding goes through `encoding.hex` afterwards. The composition
reads at the call site instead of multiplying out the verb names.

**Struct hashing is deferred.** Hashing a struct requires a
stable byte serialization (field order, padding, null handling)
which is its own design problem. Users serialize through the
relevant library (`json`, `csv`, future `cbor`) and hash the
resulting bytes; the `hash` library has no opinion on struct
layout.

## M15.4 - `encoding`

Codec library: byte-stream introspection plus the lossless
re-encoding codecs beyond UTF-8. The cross-kind `bytes <-> string`
**single-codec** pair lives in `convert`
(`convert.bytesFromString` / `convert.stringFromBytes`, UTF-8 only,
shipped with the `bytes` type in M12). `encoding` is where the
codec proliferation happens because that's where the table-based
implementations belong.

**Introspection helpers.**

- `encoding.isAscii(b as bytes) -> bool` - every byte < 0x80.
- `encoding.lenBytes(s as string) -> int` - byte length of `$s`'s
  UTF-8 encoding (contrast with `len($s)`, which is the rune
  count).
- `encoding.lenRunes(b as bytes) -> int` - decoded rune count of
  valid UTF-8 `bytes`; errors on invalid UTF-8.
- `encoding.hex(b)` / `encoding.fromHex(s)` - lowercase hex
  round-trip.
- `encoding.base64(b)` / `encoding.fromBase64(s)` - standard
  base64 (RFC 4648); url-safe variant via a modifier ships in
  the same release.

**Codec table API.** The shape mirrors convert's:

- `encoding.encode(s as string, codec as string) -> bytes` -
  encode a Jennifer string into the named codec.
- `encoding.decode(b as bytes, codec as string) -> string` -
  decode bytes from the named codec.

Both error positionally on (a) unknown codec, (b) bytes that
don't validly decode in the named codec, or (c) string runes
that don't representably encode (e.g. a string containing
`U+1F600` into Latin-1).

**Codec set shipped in M15.4.** All single-byte (and ASCII), so
each costs at most one 256-entry table:

- **`"ascii"`** - 7-bit ASCII; rejects any byte >= 0x80 on decode
  and any rune >= 0x80 on encode. Trivial; useful for strict
  protocol validation.
- **`"latin-1"` / `"iso-8859-1"`** - one-to-one mapping with
  Unicode block U+0000-U+00FF. No table needed - it's the
  identity in that range. Aliases resolve to the same codec.
- **`"iso-8859-2"` through `"iso-8859-16"`** - Central/Eastern
  European, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Turkish, Nordic,
  Celtic, South-Eastern European. One 256-entry table each;
  encode is the inverse lookup. (Codec strings normalised so
  `"iso-8859-2"`, `"iso88592"`, `"latin-2"` all resolve to the
  same codec.)
- **`"windows-1250"` through `"windows-1258"`** - Microsoft's
  Western, Central, Cyrillic, Greek, Turkish, Hebrew, Arabic,
  Baltic, and Vietnamese code pages. Same shape as the ISO-8859
  family; one table each. **Windows-1252** is the highest-priority
  member - it's the de-facto encoding of "Latin-1 with smart
  quotes" found in countless real-world Windows files mislabeled
  as Latin-1.
- **`"ebcdic"`** - IBM mainframe code page (specifically
  IBM-1047, the modern Latin-1 EBCDIC variant). One table.
  Narrow relevance but free to ship now that the table loader
  is in place; lets Jennifer talk to mainframe data without a
  separate library.

**Codec name normalisation.** Codec strings are case-insensitive
and ignore `-` / `_` / spaces, so `"ISO-8859-1"`, `"iso88591"`,
`"latin_1"` all resolve to the same codec. The canonical form
returned by `encoding.codecs() -> list of string` is lowercase
with the hyphen form. Common aliases (`"latin-1"` for
`"iso-8859-1"`, `"cp1252"` for `"windows-1252"`) are accepted on
input.

**What stays out of M15.4 (deferred to later milestones).**

- Variable-width Asian encodings: `Shift-JIS`, `Big5`, `GB2312`,
  `GBK`, `GB18030`, `EUC-JP`, `EUC-KR`. Each is a state-machine
  implementation with multiple variants and ambiguity edge cases;
  one or two of these is a whole milestone of work, not a row in
  a table.
- `UTF-16` / `UTF-16LE` / `UTF-16BE` and `UTF-32` - byte-order
  marks, surrogate pair handling, endianness. Real but separate
  work.
- `UTF-7`, `quoted-printable`, mail-transport hacks - belong
  with `mail` / `mime` library work, not core encoding.

These ship in their own sub-milestone once a real Jennifer
program needs them - currently no roadmap item depends on them.

## M15.5 - distribution + first public release

The last step before Phase C. Phase B finishes the foundational
library batch; M15.5 makes that batch a thing people can actually
install and run before Phase C starts adding I/O on top. The
items below have been on the parallel "Path to 1.0.0
distribution" track for a while; promoting them to a real
milestone means they get tested, polished, and released as a
unit instead of trickled in piecemeal.

This is a packaging / CI / release-engineering milestone, not a
language change. Nothing new ships in the `.j` source language.

**Two binaries per release (both supported).**

Benchmarks on the dev machine showed Go-compiled Jennifer is
~3-4x faster than TinyGo-compiled Jennifer for CPU-bound code
(loops, recursion, arithmetic), while TinyGo wins by ~1.7x on
allocation-heavy patterns where its lighter GC pays off. The
size delta is small (TinyGo ~2.4 MB vs Go ~3.9 MB on the dev
machine; bare-metal numbers will differ from a VM). Both
binaries ship per platform:

- `jennifer` - **TinyGo build, canonical**. The design-target
  binary: McFly OS embedding, wasm, embedded contexts all want
  this one. Default download path in the README and docs.
- `jennifer-go` - **Go build, performance variant**. For users
  running compute-bound Jennifer where the 3-4x speedup matters
  more than the size or embedding story. Same source, same
  language; only the compiler differs.

The release README ships with the benchmark numbers re-run on
the release CI so users can pick informed. The "which binary?"
guidance lives in `docs/user-guide/installing.md` so the
decision is documented in one place.

**GitHub Actions.**

- **`test.yml`** - runs `go test ./...` and `make build`
  (TinyGo) on every push and PR. Caches the Go and TinyGo
  module caches so PR runs stay fast. Currently we run tests
  locally only; this puts a green-checkmark gate on every PR
  and stops broken-build PRs from landing.
- **`release.yml`** - triggered on git tag matching `v*.*.*`.
  Builds both `jennifer` (TinyGo) and `jennifer-go` (Go)
  binaries for the supported platforms (linux/amd64 + arm64
  initially; macOS + Windows once cross-platform support
  lands in a follow-on sub-milestone), runs the benchmark
  suite on the release runner, produces a release notes
  template with the benchmark table filled in, and publishes
  to GitHub Releases.

**Packaging.**

- **Debian** (`.deb`). Built from the release artifact. Ships
  `/usr/bin/jennifer` (TinyGo) and `/usr/bin/jennifer-go` (Go
  variant) plus man-page stubs and `.j` extension MIME
  registration. The package is hosted as a GitHub Release
  artifact initially; a real apt repository follows if/when
  there's user demand.
- **Arch** (`PKGBUILD`). Two AUR packages: `jennifer-bin`
  (downloads the prebuilt artifact, fast install) and
  `jennifer-git` (builds from source, tracks master). Both
  install the TinyGo + Go binaries side by side.
- **pacman** (`.pacman` package format). Pre-built for users
  who want the binary form without going through AUR's
  source-package workflow.

**Documentation site.**

GitHub Pages driven from `docs/` (mdBook is the leading
candidate; needs a design pass for the navigation/landing
shape). The site goes live with M15.5 so the release
announcement has somewhere to link to that isn't a GitHub
file tree. Versioned per release tag.

**What stays on the "Path to 1.0.0 distribution" parallel
track** (post-M15.5 polish, not gated on this milestone):

- Homebrew tap for macOS users
- Snap package
- Nix flake / Nix package
- Cross-build for macOS (waits on platform-portability work
  first)
- Cross-build for Windows (same)

These are post-1.0 polish that the parallel track keeps tracking;
they ship when they ship and don't block M16.0.

---

**Phase C: I/O libraries (M16.x).** System libraries that touch the
OS or do significant compute. Phase C opens with a language
addition (M16.0 - concurrency primitives) because every I/O library
in the phase wants to know whether spawned work and async waits
are available; the I/O libraries themselves (M16.1+) ship in the
same phase atop that foundation.

## M16.0 - Lightweight concurrency

Adds `spawn { ... }` and a `task of T` value type so I/O can
proceed without blocking the whole program. Lands as a
prerequisite of M16.1-M16.3 (any of which can use it for
non-blocking calls) and a hard requirement for M20 `httpd` (a
single-connection web server isn't a server). The decision to
ship goroutine-style concurrency rather than `async`/`await` or
raw OS threads is recorded with the reasoning at
[technical/rejected.md > async/await coloring](technical/rejected.md#asyncawait-function-coloring)
once the milestone work begins; the short version is "Jennifer's
value semantics already provide the isolation that
async-await / borrow-checking exist to enforce."

**Why now.** Jennifer's value-semantics decision (M6 lists/maps,
M12 bytes, M13.1 structs - all copied on assignment and
parameter binding) means a spawned block cannot accidentally
share mutable state with the parent. Every captured variable is
deep-copied at spawn time, identical to a function call. The
hardest problem in shared-memory concurrency - data races on
mutable state - cannot happen by construction. We get that
property for free from a decision we made for unrelated reasons,
which is what makes "ship concurrency" a smaller surface than it
would be in a reference-semantics language.

**Syntax.**

```jennifer
# spawn { ... } runs the body in a separate goroutine. Variables
# captured from the enclosing scope are deep-copied at spawn time,
# same semantics as a method call. The block's `return EXPR;`
# becomes the task's result; bare `return;` produces null.
def t as task of int init spawn {
    return computeStuff();
};

# task.wait blocks until the spawned block finishes and returns the
# value. If the block threw an error, task.wait re-throws it in the
# waiter's frame.
def result as int init task.wait($t);
```

**New type kind: `task of T`.** A compound type that wraps a
pending or completed computation. Constructed only by `spawn`;
read only via the `task` library. Value semantics: a
`task of T` value is small (essentially a handle), and copying
it shares the same underlying task (single result, multiple
waiters get the same value or the same re-thrown error - "the
task" exists once even if the handle moves). This is the **one
exception** to Jennifer's "no shared references" rule, and it's
necessary - a task by definition represents a single underlying
operation. The exception is contained: `task of T` values can
only be acted on through the `task.*` API, which itself is
side-effect-careful.

**New keyword: `spawn`.** Statement-position only - same shape
as `if`/`while`/`for`/`repeat`. The spawn block is a fresh
scope; the spawn body runs concurrently with the rest of the
program.

**Value-semantics capture.** Variables referenced inside
`spawn { ... }` from the enclosing scope are deep-copied into
the spawned frame at the moment of spawn, same as how a method
call deep-copies its arguments. The spawned block sees its own
copy; mutations don't propagate back; the parent's bindings are
untouched:

```jennifer
def xs as list of int init [1, 2, 3];
def t as task of null init spawn {
    $xs[0] = 999;       # mutates the spawned frame's copy
    return null;
};
task.wait($t);
# $xs in the parent is still [1, 2, 3].
```

**Error propagation.** Errors thrown inside a `spawn` block are
captured by the task. Calling `task.wait` re-throws them in the
waiter's frame, where ordinary `try`/`catch` (M13.2) handles
them:

```jennifer
def t as task of int init spawn {
    throw Error{kind: "boom", message: "...", file: "", line: 0, col: 0};
};
try {
    def n as int init task.wait($t);
} catch (err) {
    io.printf("caught: %s\n", $err.message);
}
```

A task whose error was never waited on **silently drops** the
error when GC'd. (Jennifer has no finalizers; surfacing dropped
errors would require one.) Users who care about every error
should always `wait` or `discard`. Recommended idiom for
fire-and-forget: explicit `task.discard($t);` so the intent is
visible at the call site.

**`task` library (built-in, shipped with M16.0).**

| Function                        | Effect                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task.wait(t) -> T`             | Block until `t` completes; return its value or re-throw its error.                                                     |
| `task.poll(t) -> bool`          | Non-blocking check: true if `t` has completed (value or error available).                                              |
| `task.discard(t)`               | Mark `t` as fire-and-forget; suppresses dropped-error logging if it's ever added.                                      |
| `task.waitAll(ts) -> list of T` | Wait for every task in `$ts`; return their results in order. Re-throws the first error encountered (others discarded). |
| `task.waitAny(ts) -> int`       | Wait until any task in `$ts` completes; return its index. Caller then `task.wait`s that one.                           |

`waitAll` / `waitAny` cover the most common patterns (parallel
map-fold and "first to respond wins"). Anything more complex
(timeouts, racing N tasks with cancellation of losers, etc.)
ships in a `task.x` sub-milestone if a real use case forces it.

**Multi-core / parallelism.** Spawn blocks compile to goroutines
and Go's scheduler runs them across every available core by
default - so on hosted builds (Linux / macOS / Windows desktop)
M16.0 *is* multi-core parallelism, not just concurrency.
Data-race-freedom holds by construction because value-semantics
capture deep-copies every variable at spawn time; the data races
that drive most parallel-programming bugs cannot happen.

Two target classes need an explicit fallback:

- **Single-threaded TinyGo targets** (WASI, baremetal embedded)
  and **macflyos** have no OS threads to schedule across. The
  interpreter ships a **`--cooperative` mode** for these builds
  in which `spawn` blocks run on a single OS thread with a
  cooperative scheduler; the same source program runs without
  modification, just sequentially. Semantics remain identical -
  the only observable difference is wall-clock behavior.
- **Per-goroutine interpreter state stays single-threaded.**
  Each `spawn` walks the AST sequentially in its own goroutine;
  making the tree-walker itself internally parallel
  (lock-free environments, concurrent scope chains) is a
  different and much harder project with near-zero payoff for
  the workloads Jennifer targets and is deliberately out of
  scope.

Finer-grained scheduling control (CPU affinity, work-stealing
pools, NUMA awareness, `GOMAXPROCS`-equivalent tuning) is
recorded in the Long horizon list - those are advanced-runtime
knobs, not language features, and the same "ships when a real
use case forces it" rule applies.

**What's NOT in v1 (deliberate; defer until a forcing function appears).**

- **Channels** (`chan of T`, `chan.send`, `chan.recv`). Tasks
  cover the futures use case; channels cover pipelines /
  fan-in / fan-out. The pipeline patterns can be expressed with
  lists of tasks and `waitAll` until that proves clumsy. Add
  channels in a follow-on sub-milestone if/when real programs
  need them.
- **Mutexes / locks.** Value-semantics capture removes the
  shared-mutable-state-needs-locking case. If users want a
  shared counter, they spawn a goroutine that owns it and
  communicate via tasks (actor-style).
- **Cancellation.** Famously hard to do right (Go added
  `context.Context` years after goroutines). Spawned blocks
  cannot be killed; they run to completion. Tasks that take a
  long time and may need stopping should check a flag the
  parent sets via shared state - but since Jennifer has no
  shared state, the pattern is "use a quick task plus a
  user-managed sentinel value." Concrete API ships when a real
  use case surfaces.
- **Timeouts.** Same family as cancellation. Workaround:
  `task.waitAny([$work, $timer])` where `$timer` is a task
  that spawns and sleeps. Wait for whichever returns first.
- **Go-style `select`.** Multi-channel select belongs with
  channels.
- **`context.Context` propagation.** Belongs with cancellation.

**Interaction with existing language features.**

- **`exit` inside a spawn**: terminates the whole program (same
  as outside spawn). The spawn keyword does not create a frame
  that catches `exit`; it's still the global escape hatch.
- **`return` inside a spawn**: returns from the spawn block,
  producing the task's value. Does not return from the
  enclosing method. (Symmetric with how `return` inside a method
  body returns from the method, not from the enclosing
  top-level.)
- **`break` / `continue` inside a spawn**: error at parse time
  - they make no sense without an enclosing loop, and the
    spawn's lexical block does not transparently see loops in
    the parent.
- **`throw` inside a spawn**: captured by the task and re-thrown
  on `wait`, as documented above.
- **try/catch crossing a spawn boundary**: a `try` in the
  parent does **not** catch errors raised inside an
  unwaited-on `spawn`. The `task.wait($t)` site is where errors
  enter the catchable channel.

**REPL interaction.** A `spawn` from a REPL input runs
concurrently; subsequent inputs can `task.wait` on it. The line
editor owns stdin (same M5 rule as `io.readLine`), so spawned
blocks must not read from stdin while the REPL is interactive.

**Internals.**

- `spawn { body }` lowers to a Go goroutine that runs the body
  with a deep-copied frame. The goroutine sends `{value, error}`
  to a one-shot Go channel; the `task of T` value wraps that
  channel.
- `task.wait` blocks on the channel; on receive, returns the
  value or wraps the error and routes it through the same
  `ErrorSignal` machinery M13.2 introduces. The waiter's frame
  position is what `catch` blocks see.
- TinyGo's goroutine implementation depends on the target;
  Linux native (the shipping target today) uses preemptive
  scheduling on top of OS threads, so `spawn` can give real
  parallelism on multi-core systems. WASM targets use
  cooperative scheduling. The McFly OS embedding inherits
  whatever scheduling its TinyGo build configures.
- Tests: a synthetic interpreter helper installs a "spawn that
  runs the body inline" mode so deterministic tests don't
  depend on goroutine scheduling.

**Library impact.**

- **M16.1 `fs`** can ship blocking read/write that callers wrap
  in `spawn` for non-blocking. No `fs.readAsync(...)`
  duplication API needed - the user composes with `spawn`.
- **M16.2 `net`** likewise. Accept-loop / per-connection servers
  spawn a task per connection.
- **M19 `crypto`** doesn't need concurrency directly but the
  M19 hash/crypto helpers can be composed under `spawn` for
  parallel hashing of large inputs.
- **M20 `httpd`** is the headline consumer. The accept loop
  becomes `while (true) { def conn init net.accept($listener); spawn { handle($conn); } }`.

See:
- [user-guide/concurrency.md](user-guide/concurrency.md) (new
  doc at M16.0 implementation time) - the user-facing tour with
  worked examples (parallel fetch, request handler, fire-and-forget
  logging).
- [libraries/task.md](libraries/task.md) (new) - the `task.*`
  function reference.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Concurrency](technical/interpreter.md#concurrency) (new
  subsection) - goroutine mapping, frame copying, error
  routing, test-only inline mode.

## M16.1 - `fs`

File I/O. `fs.read`, `fs.write` for `string` and `bytes`,
`fs.stat` returning a struct, directory walk. Requires M11
(bytes) and M13.1 (structs). Brings the M7-deferred file handles
and any non-stdin input source (`fs.open(path) -> handle`,
`handle.readLine()`, etc.) under one library.

## M16.2 - `net`

Sockets. Plain TCP and UDP first; TLS deferred to its own
sub-milestone. The first place a real `bytes` round-trip
matters. Ships blocking calls; non-blocking use composes through
M16.0 `spawn` rather than duplicating each call as
`net.acceptAsync`, `net.readAsync`, etc.

## M16.3 - `regex`

Regular expressions over `string`. Large standalone milestone;
pure string processing, no other dependencies.

---

**Phase D: higher-level and Jennifer-coded libraries (M17-M20).**

## M17 - Module system for Jennifer-coded libraries

Real modules so Jennifer-coded libraries get namespaces, scope,
and explicit exports. Adopts "**module**" as the canonical
wording for a distributable `.j` library (matches Python, ES2015,
Rust); "bundle" deliberately not used because it overloads the
JS build-output term. The `include "x.j";` keyword (renamed in
M10) stays as the textual-splice form for inline composition
inside one source tree; library distribution moves to modules
via `import`.

Split into four sub-milestones so each piece ships standalone
and lands in dependency order: source-tree layout first, then
the import syntax, then resolution, then exports. M18.x cannot
start until all four ship.

## M17.1 - Source tree separation

A new top-level `modules/` directory holds Jennifer-coded
modules; system (Go-built) libraries stay in `internal/lib/*/`.
The split is load-bearing for distro packaging: system
libraries are baked into the interpreter binary, so a Debian
package only ships `/usr/bin/jennifer`; modules are data files
that ship to a system module dir
(`/usr/share/jennifer/modules/` or `/var/lib/jennifer/modules/`,
decided at packaging time) and are loadable without
recompilation. The directory exists from M17.1; the modules
shipped in M18.x land directly in it.

## M17.2 - `import "modules/foo.j" as foo;` syntax

The real module boundary. The imported file's top-level names
live behind the `foo.` prefix at the call site, the same shape
as a namespaced system library. Aliasing rules match
`use NAME as ALIAS;` (alias replaces the canonical name; bare
form reserves the file-stem as the prefix). Reuses the
namespacing machinery shipped in M10 so call-site resolution is
already settled.

## M17.3 - Module resolution

A search path with explicit precedence: the current source
file's directory first, then any `-I` directories passed on
the command line, then the system module dir. No implicit
fallback to system libraries - a `use NAME;` always means a
system library, `import "..." as ...;` always means a module
file. Matches the explicit-prefix rule recorded in
[rejected.md > Implicit `use NAME;` fallback chain](technical/rejected.md#implicit-use-name-fallback-chain-m8).

## M17.4 - Module-level exports

Top-level `def` and `func` are exported by default; a leading
`private` marker (or similar; settled at start of M17.4) hides
them. Same visibility rule top-to-bottom; no per-file export
list. Ships last because it's the only piece that touches
parser grammar - M17.1 through M17.3 are tooling and
resolution.

## M17.5 - Developer tooling: profiling

A `jennifer profile <prog.j>` subcommand that instruments the
evaluator to attribute work back to Jennifer source positions -
the gap left by `go tool pprof`, which profiles the interpreter
binary, not the .j program running inside it. Lands between M17
(modules) and M18.x (Jennifer-coded libraries) so library
authors can profile their code from the moment they start
writing it; deliberately not under M16.x because it isn't an
I/O library and doesn't fit the phase grouping.

- **Statement / call profile.** The default mode. Per source
  position (file:line:col) record hit count and cumulative
  wall-clock time spent in that statement / expression.
  Output formats: a flat human-readable table by default,
  pprof-compatible binary via `--format=pprof`, Chrome-trace
  JSON via `--format=trace`. Existing flamegraph tooling
  (`go tool pprof`, https://www.speedscope.app/) consumes
  both forms so we don't ship a renderer.
- **Allocation tracking.** Optional second mode
  (`--allocs`) that counts `Value.Copy()` and Value-build
  sites per source position. Jennifer's value semantics
  make every copy load-bearing; surfacing "this struct
  passes through 40 frames per call" is exactly the
  kind of insight that compiled-language allocation
  profilers give. Same output formats as the statement
  profile.
- **TinyGo-friendliness.** Profiling code lives behind the
  `profile` subcommand and a build tag so it doesn't bloat
  the shipping `jennifer` binary. The macflyos embedding
  target gets the profiler-free build; desktop / dev
  builds get both.
- **Out of scope for v1.** No source-step debugger (its
  own milestone if/when it lands).
- **May absorb future developer-tooling work.** Source-level
  debugger hooks, runtime introspection, and any other
  `jennifer <tool>` subcommand that instruments the
  evaluator can ship as sub-milestones under M17.5.x rather
  than getting their own top-level slots.

## M18.x - Jennifer-coded modules

Built atop the existing system libraries. Each one ships as a
Jennifer **module** under `modules/` (the directory introduced in
M17); none of them are compiled into the interpreter binary.
Sub-milestones in priority order:

- **M18.1 - `http`** (client) - atop `net`.
- **M18.2 - `json`** - data interchange ubiquity.
- **M18.3 - `csv`** - simple, useful early.
- **M18.4 - `yaml`, `xml`, `markdown`, `pretty`** - one or more
  sub-milestones depending on scope when planned.

## M19 - `crypto`

Symmetric and asymmetric primitives, key derivation,
crypto-grade random. System library; TinyGo-safe primitives
only. Hashes already shipped in M15.3.

## M20 - `httpd`

Pure-Jennifer HTTP server atop `net`. Ships as a module under
`modules/httpd.j` (same packaging shape as the M18 modules), not
baked into the interpreter. The point where Jennifer becomes
useful for serving content. Depends on **M16.0 concurrency**
(per-connection handlers run in `spawn` blocks) and M16.2 `net`
(the underlying TCP listener).

---

**Phase E: WASM and specialised domains (M21+).** Not committed to a
timeline; recorded so the design doesn't foreclose them.

## M21 - WASM runtime embedding

Wazero or similar inside the interpreter binary. TinyGo-size
cost evaluated honestly before commitment. Without M21, no WASM
libraries.

## M22.x - WASM libraries

If M21 ships, sandboxed plugins via `use wasm:libname;`. Each
library a sub-milestone.

## M23+ - Specialised domains

Each domain its own milestone with sub-milestones as needed:

- **ML.** Vector, matrix, stats, ML primitives.
- **Bioinformatics.** Sequence alignment (Smith-Waterman,
  Needleman-Wunsch), FASTA/FASTQ parsers, molecule structures.
- **Sandbox.** Restricted-capability execution.

Ordered when demand surfaces. WASM libraries (M22.x) may cover
some of this space first.

---

## Path to 1.0.0 distribution (parallel track)

The core CI + release + packaging items that used to live here
were promoted into M15.5 (the last step before Phase C). What
stays on this parallel track is the post-M15.5 polish - items
that can land any time and don't block any milestone:

- **Homebrew tap** for macOS users.
- **Snap** package.
- **Nix flake** / Nix package.
- **Cross-build for macOS / Windows.** Waits on the
  platform-portability work in the Long-horizon list; ships as
  soon as that lands.
- **Real apt repository** (replacing the "GitHub Release
  artifact" install of the M15.5 `.deb`) if user demand
  warrants the maintenance.
- **Snap / Flatpak**, **AppImage**, or any other Linux
  distribution format Jennifer users actually ask for.

Each of these ships when there's user demand and a maintainer
willing to keep it green; they're not blocking anything.

---

## Long horizon (recorded, not scheduled)

- **Cross-platform support.** Today Jennifer targets Linux only.
  Windows and macOS are planned. When touching filesystem, paths,
  line endings, or process behavior, prefer portable stdlib
  helpers (`path/filepath`, not hardcoded `/`); avoid Linux-only
  assumptions.
- **McFly OS kernel integration.** Embed the Jennifer interpreter
  into **McFly OS**, an experimental OS also written in TinyGo.
  Reinforces the TinyGo-friendliness discipline: no
  `reflect`-heavy code, no goroutines in the core, no heavy
  stdlib dependencies, and no hard dependencies on a hosted
  runtime (ambient stdin, network, dynamic linking).
- **FCGI.** `use FCGI as web;` library when `net` and `httpd`
  mature. Lets Jennifer host CGI / FastCGI workloads end-to-end.
- **Inline assembler.**
- **Binary AST cache (`.jc` files).** Pre-parsed loading for big
  programs and McFly OS embedding. Its own milestone when it
  lands - file-format design, versioning, and TinyGo-safe
  serialization are enough work to merit dedicated treatment. The
  text JSON form via `jennifer ast` is the placeholder until then.
  Deferred from M5.
- **`io.lines() -> list of string`.** Slurp the whole stdin into a
  list. Additive on top of the streaming `readLine()` + `eof()`
  idiom; nice-to-have for tiny scripts, not blocking. Deferred from
  M7.
- **i18n.** Locale-aware case folding, collation, number / date
  formatting, BiDi. Gated on the CLDR-data binary-size question
  (likely an optional library shipped after the M19 WASM runtime
  so locale tables aren't baked into every build).
- **Host-embedding API.** A stable, documented Go-side surface
  for driving the interpreter from a host program (passing
  values in / out, surfacing positioned errors, hooking stdout
  / stdin). Distinct from FFI as conventionally meant - see
  [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md#ffi-as-a-single-milestone)
  for why that framing was turned down. Likely Phase D/E timing
  (around M18-M19), since macflyos embedding and any
  serious host-driven use case need it.
- **Advanced scheduling knobs.** CPU affinity, work-stealing
  pool sizing, NUMA awareness, `GOMAXPROCS`-equivalent runtime
  tuning. Runtime-config surface for the M16.0 spawn scheduler,
  not new language features. Ships when a real use case forces
  it (the M16.0 default - "let Go's scheduler decide" -
  handles every workload we've imagined so far).
- **Performance & memory.** Interpreter-internal optimizations
  that preserve stance #5 (value semantics) at the user level:
  copy-on-write for lists / maps / bytes / structs (share
  underlying storage until a write splits it), per-frame arena
  allocation, and read-only slice views (`xs[1..5]` as a
  non-owning window that errors on assignment). Strictly
  optimizations - no user-visible aliasing or mutation rules
  change. Stance-breaking variants (mutable references,
  interior mutability, shared mutable state) are turned down in
  [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md#references-interior-mutability-shared-mutable-state).
  Best landed post-M21 once the language is settled and the
  interpreter doesn't churn under it.
