# Jennifer - Milestones

Development is split into milestones. Each milestone produces a *working*
interpreter that runs a strictly larger subset of the language.

---

## M1 - End-to-end MVP

**Status:** done.

Smallest vertical slice that proves the pipeline (source → tokens →
preprocessed tokens → AST → result):

- Types: `int`, `string`
- `def x as int init 5;`, `$var` references, method defs (zero-arg, top
  level), `import "file.j";`, `use io;`, single-arg `printf`
- Arithmetic `+ - * / %` on ints; comments `#` and `/* */`
- Source-context caret in error messages
- Golden-file integration test and TinyGo build verified

**Exit criterion:** `./jennifer run examples/hello.j` prints `42`.

---

## M2 - Types, constants, scoping, control flow

**Status:** done.

Rounds out the "ordinary" feature set:

- New types `float`, `null`, `bool` with literals `3.14`, `null`, `true`,
  `false`
- Uninitialized `def x as T;` gives `T`'s zero value
- `def const NAME as TYPE init VALUE;` (reassignment is an error)
- Nested block scoping; inner scopes cannot redeclare visible names
- Assignment statement `$x = EXPR;`
- Comparison `< > <= >= ==`, `+` for string concat, `int`↔`float`
  promotion
- Escape parsing in `'...'` strings (previously only `"..."`)
- Control flow: `if`/`elseif`/`else`, `while`, `for`, all requiring
  `bool` conditions (no implicit truthiness)

---

## M3 - Methods with parameters and return values

**Status:** done.

- `func name(a as int, b as string) { ... }` with typed parameters,
  by-value argument passing, call-site arity + type checks
- `return;` and `return EXPR;`; recursion works
- `sprintf` and format verbs `%d %f %s %t %v %%` for both `printf` and
  `sprintf`
- The omnibus `stdlib` retired in favor of topic-based libraries; `io`
  is the first.

---

## M4 - Polish & ergonomics

**Status:** done.

- Logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` (word-based, short-circuit)
- Unary minus
- Python-3 division: `/` always returns `float`; new `div` keyword for 
  floor division (`//` is taken by line comments)
- Floats always display with a decimal (`5.0`, not `5`) so the type
  stays visible
- New libraries (all `use`-gated): [`convert`](libraries/convert.md),
  [`math`](libraries/math.md), [`strings`](libraries/strings.md)
- Interpreter gained `RegisterConst` so libraries can expose constants
  (`PI`, `E`).

---

## M5 - Interpreter improvements

**Status:** done.

- **Cross-file error sources** - errors raised inside an imported `.j`
  display the line from the imported file. See
  [technical/interpreter.md > Errors and positions](technical/interpreter.md#errors-and-positions-cross-file).
- **REPL** - `jennifer repl`, persistent globals/methods/imports across
  inputs, multi-line input via brace balancing, expression results
  printed. See [technical/cli_repl.md > REPL](technical/cli_repl.md#repl-cmdjenniferreplgo).
- **REPL line editor** - cursor keys, Home/End, word motions, Ctrl+W /
  Ctrl+U / Ctrl+K, in-memory history (Up/Down), Ctrl+C cancel. Non-TTY
  stdin falls back to plain line reading. See
  [technical/cli_repl.md > Line editor](technical/cli_repl.md#line-editor-cmdjenniferlineeditgo-cmdjenniferhistorygo).
- **Auto-loaded `core` library** - new library kind, pre-imported at
  startup; writing `use core;` is a runtime error. Contents:
  `JENNIFER_VERSION` (a `git describe`-derived build-version constant)
  and `len` (polymorphic over strings now; lists/maps in M6). `len`
  moved here from `strings`. (M15.4 later promoted `len` to a
  language built-in and deleted `core`; see M15.4 for the
  migration.) Version injection details at
  [technical/cli.md](technical/cli.md#version-injection).
- **Formatter** - `jennifer fmt` re-emits canonical source per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md). Token-level walker so file imports and
  user-written parentheses survive. See
  [technical/cli_fmt.md > Formatter](technical/cli_fmt.md#formatter-cmdjenniferfmtgo).
- **Inspection subcommands** - `jennifer tokens <file>` dumps the lexer
  output; `jennifer ast <file>` dumps the preprocessed AST as JSON.
  See [technical/cli_inspect.md > Inspection](technical/cli_inspect.md#inspection-tokens-and-ast).
- **Underscore-in-constants** - constant names became `[A-Z]+(_[A-Z]+)*`,
  enabling `MAX_RETRIES` and the `JENNIFER_VERSION` rename. See
  [technical/lexer.md > Identifier rule](technical/lexer.md#identifier-rule).
- **Documentation overhaul** - `docs/technical.md` split into
  `docs/technical/<topic>.md`; `docs/lib_*.md` moved to
  `docs/libraries/`; new `docs/user-guide/style-guide.md`.

---

## M6 - Lists and maps

**Status:** done.

Two new compound types - `list` and `map` - plus the strings library
functions deferred until compound types existed.

- **Syntax**: `def xs as list of int init [1, 2, 3];`,
  `def m as map of string to int init {"a": 1};`. Index read/write
  `$xs[i]`, `$m["k"]`, chains `$g[i][j]`. Iteration via
  `for (def x in $coll) { ... }` (new keyword `in`). New tokens
  `[ ] :` and keywords `list`, `map`, `of`, `to`, `in`.
- **Semantics**: value-typed (copy on assignment and on
  function-parameter binding; no aliasing); `const` is deep
  (`$NUMS[0] = ...` is a runtime error if `NUMS` is `const`);
  out-of-bounds list reads/writes and missing map keys are positioned
  runtime errors; map iteration is insertion-order deterministic.
- **Type system**: `parser.Type` became a recursive struct
  (`Element`, `KeyType`, `ValType` `*Type` slots), so nesting like
  `list of list of int` falls out without depth cap. 3+ levels is a
  documented code smell.
- **Stdlib**: `core.len` extended to lists and maps; `core.has(m, key)`
  for membership tests; `strings.split`, `strings.chars`,
  `strings.join` finished.
- **Tooling**: formatter handles `[...]` / `{...}` per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md) (no inner padding, space after `,`/`:`,
  block-vs-map disambiguation via a small brace stack); AST JSON
  emitter handles `ListLit`, `MapLit`, `IndexExpr`, `IndexAssignStmt`,
  `ForEachStmt`.

See [user-guide/types-and-values.md > Lists and maps](user-guide/types-and-values.md#lists-and-maps) for
the user-facing tour, and
[technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) /
[technical/interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md) for the
implementation contract.

## M7 - printf modifiers, stdin input, comment/division swap

**Status:** done.

A breaking syntax change to free up `//` for integer division and to
allow shebangs, the long-promised format-verb modifier system, and
the first stdin-reading builtins.

- **Comments and integer division** (**BREAKING**). Line comments
  moved from `//` to `#`, freeing `//` for floor division (Python 3
  shape). `div` keyword removed. A Jennifer file can now begin with
  `#!/usr/bin/env -S jennifer run`.
- **`(s)printf` format-verb modifiers.** Each format verb except `%v`
  accepts a pipe-separated, order-independent flag list:
  `%verb[|key=value]*`. Modifiers shape *presentation* only - data
  transformations (`case=upper` on strings, markdown rendering, etc.)
  are explicitly out of scope; libraries do that work. Verbs gained:
  `pad`/`max`/`align`/`mode` (`%s`); `pad`/`fill`/`align`/`base`/
  `sign`/`group`/`sep` (`%d`); `prec`/`trim`/`sci`/`pad`/`align`/
  `sign` (`%f`); `case` (`%t`); shared `null=empty|null|literal(...)`
  across all four typed verbs. `%v` deliberately takes none.
- **Format-string breaking change.** `|` immediately after a verb
  now starts a modifier list. Pre-M7 strings with `|` as a literal
  separator (`"%d|%d"`) need either a different separator or the
  `||` escape (parallels `%%`).
- **`io` stdin input.** New builtins `readLine()`,
  `readLine(prompt)`, `eof()` - one-line-at-a-time reads with an
  explicit EOF predicate (`while (not eof()) { ... }`). Refuses
  inside the REPL since the line editor owns stdin.
- **Internals.** Builtin signature changed from
  `func(out io.Writer, args)` to `func(ctx BuiltinCtx, args)` so
  stdin and the REPL flag are plumbed symmetrically with stdout.
  Mechanical refactor across the ~30 existing builtins.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - full modifier and input reference.
- [technical/lexer.md](technical/lexer.md) and
  [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - the comment / division
  syntax change.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - what the modifier
  system deliberately doesn't do (data transformations, `%a`
  aggregate, `null=sql`/`null=skip`) and why the literal-pipe
  lookahead alternative was turned down.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Builtins and libraries](technical/interpreter.md#builtins-and-libraries) - the `BuiltinCtx` signature.

---

## M8 - System library namespacing

**Status:** done.

A hybrid namespace model so domain libraries can ship without
polluting the bare-name pool, plus the first real namespaced
library (`os`) so the machinery has a non-synthetic exercise.

- **Hybrid model.** Essential libraries (`io`, `convert`, `math`,
  `strings`, auto-loaded `core`) stay flat - their builtins are
  bare names. Domain libraries register through a new namespaced
  API (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) and are
  addressed by `prefix.name(...)` / `prefix.NAME`. The library's
  name doubles as the namespace prefix.
- **Qualified calls and constants.** New AST nodes
  `QualifiedCallExpr` and `QualifiedConstRefExpr`; parsed as
  `IDENT "." IDENT` (then `(` decides). Lookup is keyed by
  `(namespace, name)` and gated by `use lib;`.
- **`use NAME as ALIAS;` aliasing.** Optional `as` clause on
  `use`. Rename-not-addition: after `use bio as b;` only `b.`
  resolves, `bio.foo()` errors with a "did you mean `b`?" hint;
  the canonical name `bio` is freed for ordinary identifier use.
  Matches Python's `import foo as bar`. Aliasing is rejected for
  flat libraries (`use math as m;` errors as meaningless).
- **Namespace prefix is a reserved identifier.** After bare
  `use bio;`, `func bio() {}` errors with `shadows imported
  namespace 'bio'`. After `use bio as b;`, only `b` is reserved.
- **No migration.** The change is purely additive; all five flat
  essentials continue to work unchanged.
- **Demo library `os` (minimal slice).** First namespaced
  library: `os.platform() -> string`, `os.getEnv(name) -> string`,
  `os.JENNIFER_LF`, `os.JENNIFER_OS`. Two functions plus two
  constants - enough to exercise namespaced zero-arg calls,
  namespaced calls with arguments, namespaced constants, and
  aliasing end-to-end. Expands in M15.1.

See:
- [libraries/os.md](libraries/os.md) - the shipping demo library.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - flat vs namespaced
  policy and the rule for library authors.
- [user-guide/imports.md > Namespaced libraries and aliasing](user-guide/imports.md#namespaced-libraries-and-aliasing) -
  user-facing reference for `use NAME [as ALIAS];` and qualified
  calls.
- [user-guide/style-guide.md > Namespaced calls](user-guide/style-guide.md#namespaced-calls) -
  spacing convention around `.`.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF for
  `qualifiedCall` / `qualifiedConstRef` and the `use ... as ...`
  shape; AST table entries for the new nodes.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Namespaced libraries (M8)](technical/interpreter.md#namespaced-libraries-m8) -
  registration API, `nsPrefixes` / `nsAliasedAway` resolution
  tables, no-shadowing rule for namespace prefixes.

---

## M9 - Collection operations

**Status:** done.

Two new namespaced libraries cover the M6-deferred list/map
manipulation helpers, a small append sugar shortens the common
write pattern, and two follow-on breaking changes tidy up the
flat-vs-namespaced split.

- **`lists` library** (`use lists;`, namespaced). `lists.push`,
  `lists.pop`, `lists.first`, `lists.last`, `lists.head`,
  `lists.tail`, `lists.reverse`, `lists.sort`, `lists.contains`,
  `lists.concat`, `lists.slice`. Non-mutating - every function
  returns a new list. `sort` accepts numeric, string, or bool
  elements (mixed int/float promotes; other mixes error);
  comparator-based sort is deferred until methods are first-class.
- **`maps` library** (`use maps;`, namespaced). `maps.keys`,
  `maps.values`, `maps.has`, `maps.delete`, `maps.merge`. Same
  shape. `maps.delete` of a missing key errors (strict at
  boundaries, matching `$m[missing]`); `maps.merge` layers the
  second arg over the first.
- **Sugar: `$xs[] = item;`** - write-only target meaning "just past
  the end of the list". Equivalent to
  `$xs = lists.push($xs, item);`. Reads of `$xs[]` and chained
  forms (`$xs[0][]`) are parse errors; non-list targets error at
  runtime. New AST node `AppendStmt`.
- **BREAKING:** `has()` moved from `core` to `maps` as
  `maps.has(m, key)`. Bare `has(...)` callers now need
  `use maps;` and the qualified form. `has` was the only
  non-polymorphic name in core; `len` stays because it genuinely
  spans string / list / map.
- **BREAKING:** `strings` library moved from flat to namespaced.
  `upper(s)` → `strings.upper(s)`, `contains(s, sub)` →
  `strings.contains(s, sub)`, etc. across all 15 functions.
  `use strings;` itself is unchanged. The M8 library-author rule
  named exactly these collision-prone verbs (`contains`, `split`,
  `replace`, `join`); acting on it now keeps callers off the wrong
  shape before more libraries arrive. After M9 the remaining flat
  libraries are `io`, `convert`, `math`, and auto-loaded `core`.

See:
- [libraries/lists.md](libraries/lists.md) /
  [libraries/maps.md](libraries/maps.md) - function reference for
  each new library.
- [libraries/strings.md](libraries/strings.md) - now namespaced
  (M9 migration note at top).
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - updated flat-vs-namespaced
  catalog and the library-author rule.
- [user-guide/imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) and

  user-facing reference.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF and AST entry
  for `AppendStmt`.

---

The next phase splits into four arcs after two architectural
prerequisites: M10 lands the namespace-first library architecture
that the rest of the standard library will be built on; Phase A
(M11-M13) finishes the language so libraries have something to
stand on; M14 closes the lexer-side gap (`fmt` losing comments
and shebangs) so the first wave of struct-using libraries can
ship with doc-comments intact; Phase B (M15.x) ships the
foundational libraries that every Jennifer program needs,
finishing with **M15.8 - the first public release** (CI, prebuilt
binaries, .deb / pacman / AUR packaging); Phase C (M16.x) ships
I/O libraries on top of the now-released foundation; Phase D
(M17-M20) ships the higher-level ecosystem (Jennifer-coded
libraries, the module system that unblocks them, crypto, a
server). Phase E (WASM and specialised domains) is the long
horizon.

The library milestones use sub-numbering (M15.1, M15.2, ...) so
each library ships and is reviewed independently. This is the
first time we use sub-milestones; the practice is justified
because each library is small enough to land in a single sitting
once the language foundation is in place.

---

## M10 - Namespace-first library architecture

**Status:** done.

A pre-language-completion API-shape correction: every library is
now namespaced, with bare-name globals reserved as a narrow
`core`-only exception. Small implementation surface, large API
shape; pre-1.0 is the window for this kind of change.

- **BREAKING:** `io`, `math`, `convert` migrate to
  namespaced-only. `printf(x)` → `io.printf(x)`,
  `sqrt(x)` → `math.sqrt(x)`, etc. The "io is special, keep
  it flat" alternative was considered and rejected at kickoff
  to keep a uniform "every call carries its library name"
  rule. `strings`, `lists`, `maps`, `os` were already
  namespaced (M9/M8).
- **BREAKING:** `convert`'s four conversion callees are renamed
  to `convert.toInt`, `convert.toFloat`, `convert.toString`,
  `convert.toBool` so they don't collide with the type
  keywords (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`); `convert.typeOf`
  keeps its name. The `to`-prefix also reads as English
  ("convert to int") at the call site.
- **BREAKING:** file-splice keyword `import` → `include`.
  `include "x.j";` is the textual splice; the `import`
  keyword is reserved for the M17 module system and produces
  a migration-hint error today. Mixing-mistake diagnostics
  updated.
- **BREAKING for embedders:** registration API renamed.
  `Register` / `RegisterConst` → `RegisterGlobal` /
  `RegisterGlobalConst`, making their role explicit ("expose
  this name globally"). The namespaced API
  (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) keeps
  its name and is the recommended default. Per-library
  storage (`globalFnsByLib`, `globalConstsByLib`) so two
  libraries with the same global name can no longer silently
  overwrite each other at Install time; the resolution map
  is populated by `processImports` when a library activates.
- **`math` absorbs the planned non-crypto random helpers**:
  `math.rand()`, `math.randInt(lo, hi)`, `math.randSeed(n)`.
  Three functions don't justify their own library under the
  new threshold (next bullet); pseudo-random fits `math`'s
  pure-numeric charter. The crypto-grade variant still ships
  in M19 `crypto`. The originally planned M14.2 `random`
  library is removed.
- **`core` is the only library publishing bare-name globals.**
  `len` and `JENNIFER_VERSION` only - no `core.len` /
  `core.JENNIFER_VERSION` qualified form, because shipping the
  same name two ways violates stance #1. `core` is the
  auto-loaded escape hatch, and its asymmetric exposure is
  the whole point.
- **Three globals-publishing rules in `processImports`**, all
  forward-looking (inert today since `core` is the only
  globals-publishing library and can't be `use`d):
  1. Duplicate `use` of a globals-publishing library is
     rejected (`library 'X' already in scope`); REPL no-ops a
     repeat.
  2. `use X as Y;` where `X` has globals but no namespaced
     names is rejected as meaningless.
  3. Two active libraries publishing the same global name are
     rejected at the second `use`
     (`library "B" collides with already-active library "A"
     on global "VER"`). The pre-M10 flat-only-alias-meaningless
     check is removed for the general case but kept as rule 2.
- **Library-author guidance updated.** The
  `docs/libraries/index.md` "flat vs namespaced" framing is
  retired; the new policy is "every library is namespaced;
  only `core` ships globals via `RegisterGlobal`." The
  "deserves its own library" threshold is raised from M8's
  "3+" to **"5+ functions or constants"**: anything smaller
  folds into the most-related existing library. The non-crypto
  random helpers (3 functions) are the first case the new rule
  caught.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md),
  [libraries/math.md](libraries/math.md),
  [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md) - migrated library
  references.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - retired
  flat-vs-namespaced framing; new library-author policy and
  5+ threshold.
- [user-guide/imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) - `use` and
  `include` keyword reference; namespaced-call and aliasing
  rules.
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `convert.toInt` / `convert.toFloat` example placement in the
  "explicit conversions" section.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - "Methods
  on structs" (M14.3 trigger; recorded here in M10's wake
  because M10's review touched the same call-shape question)
  and other related rejected alternatives.

No new language features land here - that's M11.

---

**Phase A: language completion (M11-M13).** These three milestones
close the biggest daily-use gaps and add the foundational types every
later library needs.

## M11 - Control-flow completion

**Status:** done.

Closes the biggest daily-use gap in the language and rounds out the
printf modifier table at the same time. Five new keywords (`break`,
`continue`, `repeat`, `until`, `exit`) and two new printf features.

- **`break;` / `continue;`** in every loop kind
  (`while`/`for`/`for-each`/`repeat`). Innermost loop only; misuse
  outside a loop or across a method-call boundary is a positioned
  runtime error. `continue` in C-style `for` still runs the step
  before re-checking the condition (matches C/Go).
- **`repeat { } until (cond);`** post-test loop. New keywords
  `repeat` and `until`; `do { } while ...` considered and rejected
  because the inverted condition is the whole point of switching
  to `until`.
- **`exit;` / `exit EXPR;`** terminate the whole program (exit code 0
  / EXPR-as-int). Distinct from `return` (method-scoped): skips every
  caller frame and remaining top-level statement. Implemented as an
  `ExitSignal` sentinel error the CLI translates into the OS exit
  status.
- **Bundled: printf `%s|align=center`** rounds out the align set.
  Rejected on every other typed verb (centred numbers break columnar
  output).
- **Bundled: printf `%a` aggregate verb** for lists and maps
  (deferred from M7; unblocked by M6 + M9). Modifiers: `sep`, `kv`,
  `open`, `close`, `depth=N`, `null=skip`. The modifier-list parser
  was extended with a `"..."` quoted-value form (`%a|sep=", "`) so
  values can contain spaces / reserved characters; standard
  `\n \r \t \\ \"` escapes.
- **Post-dot name relaxation.** Reserved words read as identifiers in
  the name slot of a qualified call (`strings.repeat`,
  `lists.break` if anyone wrote one), preserving the `strings.repeat`
  library function after `repeat` was reserved as a loop keyword.

See:
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  `repeat`/`until`, `break`/`continue` scope rules, `exit` vs
  `return`.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `%a` modifier table,
  `%s|align=center` example, quoted modifier values.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - `%a|json=*` /
  `%a|xml=*` / `%a|yaml=*` (serialisation modifiers stayed rejected
  even after `%a` itself shipped) and the
  `do { } while` shape for the post-test loop.

## M12 - Bytes and bit operators

**Status:** done.

Adds the buffer-shaped primitive and the bit-twiddling vocabulary
the standard library needs for hashing, encoding, crypto, and
network code in later milestones.

- **New primitive type `bytes`** - mutable byte sequence; value
  semantics on assignment / parameter binding; deep-const. Reads
  yield `int` in `[0, 255]`; writes accept the same range and
  reject anything else. Append via the existing M9 `$b[] = byte;`
  sugar. `len($b)` returns the byte count.
- **New `convert.bytesFromString(s, codec)` and
  `convert.stringFromBytes(b, codec)`** - bytes ↔ string codecs.
  Only `"utf-8"` today (further codecs ship in M15.7 `encoding`).
  Invalid UTF-8 input is an error - no silent replacement
  characters.
- **Bit operators on `int`**: `& | ^ ~ << >>`. Python-style
  precedence (comparison < `|` < `^` < `&` < shifts < `+ -`),
  so `$x & 0xff == 0` parses as `($x & 0xff) == 0`. `~` is
  bitwise NOT. Shifts are arithmetic; negative count rejected;
  count >= 64 saturates to 0 / -1. `^` ships as a primitive
  operator (CPU primitive with unique algebraic properties -
  same justification `-` has against being composable from `+`
  and unary `-`).
- **Non-decimal integer literals**: hex `0xff`, octal `0o755`,
  binary `0b1010_0110`. `_` accepted between digits in any base
  (including decimal `1_000_000` and float mantissas). Never
  adjacent to the prefix or another `_`. Lexer-only change.
- **Resolves M7-deferred stdin builtins**:
  `io.readBytes(n) -> bytes` (exact n; partial at EOF then
  `io.eof()` becomes true) and `io.readChars(n) -> string`
  (n runes, UTF-8 decoded). Both compose with M7's `io.eof()`
  unchanged.

See:
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `bytes` type, value semantics, index-write rules.
- [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md) - codec functions,
  UTF-8 strictness.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `io.readBytes`,
  `io.readChars`.
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  bit-operator precedence table.
- [user-guide/syntax.md](user-guide/syntax.md) - non-decimal
  literals + digit separator.

## M13 - Structs and catchable errors

**Status:** done.

The composite-data milestone, batched into two sub-milestones in
dependency order: M13.1 ships the struct mechanism, M13.2 ships
the error-handling design that uses it. Together they unblock
every library that wants composite returns and give the language
a recoverable-error story.

## M13.1 - Structs / records

**Status:** done.

- `def struct Name { field as type, ... };` at top level
  (hoisted before the first statement; duplicate names error in
  `Run`, silently redefine in the REPL).
- Literals `Name{ field: expr, ... }` with every field required;
  `def x as Name;` (no init) zero-fills, recursing through
  nested struct fields.
- Field read `$p.field`, write `$p.field = ...;`. Lvalue chains
  mix `[index]` and `.field` freely (`$L.from.x = 5;`,
  `$bag.items[0] = 99;`); index-assign and field-assign share
  one walker.
- Value semantics like lists/maps; `const` deep at any depth.
- Strict at boundaries: unknown struct type, missing / unknown
  field at literal, field-type mismatch on write, field access
  on a non-struct value are all positioned errors.

  language angle.
- [technical/interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md#structs-m131) -
  runtime details (`KindStruct`, hoisting, unified lvalue walker).
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - `structDef`,
  `structLit`, `fieldAssign`, mixed-tail lvalues.
- `examples/structs.j` standalone; `examples/showcase.j`
  `=== M13.1 structs ===` section.

## M13.2 - `try` / `catch` / `throw`

**Status:** done.

Catchable errors. New keywords `try`, `catch`, `throw`. Depends
on M13.1 because the canonical error value is a struct.

- `try { body } catch (NAME) { handler }` runs the body and, on
  a catchable error, binds the thrown value to `$NAME` in a
  fresh per-handler scope.
- `throw EXPR;` raises any value; convention is the auto-hoisted
  `Error{kind, message, file, line, col}` struct.
- Runtime errors (out-of-bounds, missing key, type mismatch,
  etc.) are wrapped into the canonical `Error` shape on entry
  to the catch (`kind` defaults to `"runtime"` until sites
  opt in to specific tags); user code catches both kinds
  uniformly. `throw $err;` inside a catch re-raises to the
  enclosing `try`.
- **Not** catchable: `exit` (program-level escape, propagates
  through `try`); `return` / `break` / `continue` (control
  flow, flow through `try` unchanged).
- No `finally` and no typed catch in v1.
- Internals: `ErrorSignal` sentinel parallels `ExitSignal`;
  `runtimeError.Kind` field threads the symbolic tag; user code
  may not redefine the auto-hoisted `Error` struct.

## M14 - Lexer comment + blank-line preservation

**Status:** done.

Closes the two M5-deferred items (`fmt drops comments`, `fmt
drops blank lines`). No language change - the runtime still
never sees comments.

- Lexer emits trivia tokens (`TOKEN_COMMENT_LINE`,
  `TOKEN_COMMENT_BLOCK`, `TOKEN_COMMENT_SHEBANG`,
  `TOKEN_BLANK_LINE`). Shebang on line 1 col 1 is its own kind;
  runs of blank lines collapse to one.
- Preprocessor and parser strip trivia at entry; `jennifer fmt`
  walks the raw lexer stream and re-emits trivia via a dedicated
  `emitTrivia` path that doesn't disturb the surrounding state
  machine.
- Block comments nest via depth counter; unterminated comments
  error at the outermost `/*`.
- Token-level over AST-level: the original spec proposed
  AST-attached `LeadingComments` / `TrailingComment` slots and a
  `jennifer ast --with-comments` flag - dropped in favour of the
  simpler token-level path. Add them back if a future doc
  generator needs structured per-statement attachment.

See:
- [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md#comments) -
  Comments section (block comments nest; inline-comment spacing
  exception).
- [technical/lexer.md](technical/lexer.md#comments) - trivia
  emission, shebang detection, nesting depth counter.
- [technical/cli_fmt.md](technical/cli_fmt.md) - `fmt`'s trivia re-emission.

**Phase B: foundational libraries (M15.x).** Small,
frequently-used libraries grouped under M15 with sub-numbering.
The leading M15.0 slot is the "wrap-up of existing libraries"
(extensions to M8 / M9 / M10 libraries that depend on language
features added since); later slots ship a new library each.
M15.8 closes the phase by making the result installable before
Phase C starts adding I/O on top.

## M15 - foundational libraries + first public release

**Status:** done. All nine sub-milestones shipped. Three are
language work (M15.2, M15.4), the rest are library / tooling /
release work. Two recurring patterns surfaced in the shipped
APIs and are worth remembering:
- **Codec-table shape** (algorithm/format/codec passed as a
  string argument). Used by `hash.compute(b, algo)`,
  `crc.compute(b, algo)`, `encoding.encode(s, codec)`,
  `encoding.toText(b, format)`. Originally adopted because
  Jennifer's letters-only identifier rule rejects digits in
  method names (so `hash.md5(...)` won't parse), but it also
  honours stance #1 by collapsing parallel verbs into one.
- **Integer-handle struct for opaque resources** (M15.2's
  namespaced-struct mechanism + a single `id as int` field
  indexing into a Go-side map). Used by `os.Process`,
  `hash.Stream`, `crc.Stream`.

### M15.0 - existing-library extensions

**Done.** Two extensions to the M9 `lists` library that needed
post-M14 language features: `lists.shuffle(xs)` (Fisher-Yates,
respects `math.randSeed`) and `lists.range(start, end[, step])`
(half-open, deliberate single-arg omission per stance #2). See
[libraries/lists.md](libraries/lists.md#shuffle) and
[technical/design-decisions.md > Half-open ranges](technical/design-decisions.md#half-open-ranges)
for the half-vs-closed-range rationale.

### M15.1 - `os` + `meta` (process metadata)

**Done.** Reshapes the M8-era `os` surface around one rule:
immutable per-run host facts are uppercase constants
(`PLATFORM`, `ARCH`, `EOL`, `DIRSEP`, `PATHSEP`, `ARGS`),
operations are functions (`getEnv`, `hasFlag`, `flag`). Drops
the `JENNIFER_` prefix that only made sense for bare-global use,
and introduces a new `meta` library for interpreter-self-identity
constants (`VERSION`, `BUILD`). CLI forwards trailing args to
`os.ARGS` (script path at index 0). Breaking renames
(`JENNIFER_VERSION` -> `meta.VERSION`, `os.platform()` ->
`os.PLATFORM`, `os.JENNIFER_OS` -> `os.PLATFORM`,
`os.JENNIFER_LF` -> `os.EOL`); old names now produce plain
"undefined" errors with no rename-hint. See
[libraries/os.md](libraries/os.md) and
[libraries/meta.md](libraries/meta.md).

### M15.2 - Language: library-provided namespaced struct types

**Done.** Language work slotted inside Phase B because the next
wave of libraries (M15.3 `os.{Result,Process}`, M15.5 `time.*`,
M15.6 `hash.Stream`/`crc.Stream`, future M16.1 `fs`, M16.2 `net`)
all need their own struct types and M13.1 only handled bare-IDENT
names. Adds `def x as lib.Name;` type syntax,
`lib.Name{field: ...}` literals, and the Go-side
`Interpreter.RegisterNamespacedStruct` API. Reuses M13.1's value
semantics, deep-`const`, and strict-boundary machinery; only the
resolution path differs. User code can't register structs (Go-side
only); methods on structs and inheritance stay out of scope. See
[technical/interpreter.md > Library-provided namespaced structs](technical/interpreter.md#library-provided-namespaced-structs-m152).

### M15.3 - `os` external-program execution

**Done.** First library to consume the M15.2
namespaced-struct mechanism. Surface: `os.Result {exitCode,
stdout, stderr}` + `os.Process {pid}` as the public types;
`os.run(argv) -> Result` blocking, `os.spawn(argv) -> Process`
non-blocking, `os.wait/poll/kill(p)` for handle ops. `argv` is
always `list of string` (no shell parsing; explicit
`["sh", "-c", $cmd]` for that hop). Non-zero exit codes are
values, not errors. **TinyGo limitation**: TinyGo's runtime
doesn't implement `os/exec`, so the constrained `jennifer-tiny`
binary returns a friendly "use the default `jennifer` binary" error
instead of panicking - first place the two-binary story becomes
user-visible. See
[libraries/os.md > External programs](libraries/os.md#external-programs)
and `examples/exec.j`.

### M15.4 - Language: `len` built-in, `core` removed

**Done.** Promoted `len(EXPR)` from the auto-loaded `core` library
to a reserved keyword + language primary expression (polymorphic
over string / list / map / bytes). Deleted `internal/lib/core/`
entirely; `use core;` now returns a friendly migration error
pointing at the built-in and at `meta.VERSION` / `meta.BUILD`.
Stance #2 ("explicit over implicit") now applies uniformly: every
library name lives behind a `use NAME;` prefix, no exceptions. See
[technical/design-decisions.md > len is a language built-in](technical/design-decisions.md#len-is-a-language-built-in-not-a-library).

### M15.5 - `time`

**Done.** One opt-in library spanning instants, durations,
fixed-offset zones, strftime format/parse, and ISO 8601
round-trip. Three namespaced structs: `time.Time {nanos, offset}`
(fields private API), `time.Duration {nanos}`, and
`time.Zone {offset, name}` (fields public, so the M18.4
`timezones.j` companion can build them). Granularity (date-only
vs time-of-day-only) is a property of formatting, not the value
type. Unix timestamps are constructor / accessor pairs, not a
separate type. IANA names and DST are deferred to M18.4. Three
sub-milestones: **M15.5.1** core type + Unix + calendar + 1-based
ISO weekday + arithmetic / comparison; **M15.5.2** strftime
format/parse (chosen over Go's reference-time style for
familiarity; v1 verbs `%Y %m %d %H %M %S %z %a %A %b %B %j %u
%%`) + `time.zone(offset, name)` + `time.inZone` + the `time.UTC`
constant coexisting with the `time.utc()` function via
case-sensitive lookup + `time.iso` / `time.fromIso` RFC 3339
round-trip; **M15.5.3** the `examples/benchmark.j` side-by-side
TinyGo-vs-Go workload suite (eight workloads; the original spec's
"Sieve of Eratosthenes" became trial-division because Jennifer's
value-semantic list mutation turns the sieve into O(N^2)). See
[libraries/time.md](libraries/time.md),
`examples/time{,-format,benchmark}.j`.

### M15.6 - `hash` and `crc`

**Done.** Two opt-in libraries with parallel surfaces: `hash`
for cryptographic-style digests (`"md5"`, `"sha1"`, `"sha256"`),
`crc` for non-cryptographic checksums (`"crc32"` IEEE, `"crc64"`
with Go's `crc64.ECMA` polynomial). Output is raw `bytes`
(big-endian 4 / 8 bytes for CRC, natural width for hash). The
split keeps "transport integrity" vs "content addressing"
visible at the import line and matches Go's `crypto/*` vs
`hash/crc*` arrangement. Both libraries ship the codec-table
shape: `compute(b, algo)` one-shot, `stream(algo)` +
`update($s, $b)` + `finalize($s) -> bytes` for chunked input.
Streaming reuses the
[integer-handle pattern from `os.Process`](#m153---os-external-program-execution).
No convenience wrappers like `hash.md5String` or `hash.computeHex`
(stance #1; users compose `convert.bytesFromString` and
`encoding.toText`). Struct hashing deferred (needs stable byte
serialization, its own design problem). See
[libraries/hash.md](libraries/hash.md),
[libraries/crc.md](libraries/crc.md), `examples/hash.j`.

### M15.7 - `encoding`

**Done.** Three-part surface: introspection
(`isAscii`/`lenBytes`/`lenRunes`), binary-to-text
(`toText`/`fromText` for `"hex"`/`"base64"`/`"base64-url"`), and
character codecs (`encode`/`decode`/`codecs`). The cross-kind
UTF-8 pair stays in `convert` (M12); `encoding` owns the
table-based codec proliferation. Four codecs ship: `"ascii"`,
`"iso-8859-1"`, `"windows-1252"`, `"ebcdic"`. The spec's per-format
verbs (`encoding.hex`, `encoding.base64`, ...) consolidated into
the codec-table pair to dodge the same digit-in-identifier rule
M15.6 hit. Codec names and format strings are exact-match (the one
canonical spelling only; the original alias / case normalisation was
later dropped as a strictness lift, stance #2).
Windows-1252's five canonically-undefined positions (0x81, 0x8D,
0x8F, 0x90, 0x9D) reject symmetrically on encode and decode.
Long-tail single-byte codecs (ISO-8859-{2..16},
Windows-{1250,1251,1253..1258}) later shipped in
[M16.15](#m1615---encoding-completion), generated from the Unicode
mapping files. See
[libraries/encoding.md](libraries/encoding.md),
`examples/encoding.j`.

### M15.8 - distribution + first public release

**Done.** Packaging / CI / release-engineering only; no
`.j`-source language change. Four sub-phases:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`, `release.yml`). PR gate
  runs `go vet` + `gofmt` + `go test ./...` + `make build` +
  per-binary smoke run + repo-wide em-dash scan. Release
  triggers on bare-semver tags (`[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*`, no `v`
  prefix per project convention), cross-compiles both binaries
  for `linux/{amd64,arm64}` from one runner, QEMU-smoke-tests
  the non-native arch, runs the benchmark on amd64 so release
  notes carry fresh numbers, publishes a draft Release.
- **Packaging** under `packaging/{debian,arch,mime,man}/`.
  `scripts/build-deb.sh` produces the `.deb` (binaries +
  gzipped man pages + shared `text/x-jennifer` MIME definition
  + `update-mime-database` hooks). AUR ships `PKGBUILD-bin`
  (release tarball) and `PKGBUILD-git` (source-tracking) with
  a shared `.install` hook. Release pipeline auto-fills
  `PKGBUILD-bin` (real `pkgver` + real `sha256sums_*`) as a
  release asset so the AUR push is a one-step `curl`. The
  `.pacman` standalone artefact from the original spec was
  dropped - `PKGBUILD-bin` + `makepkg` covers the same need.
- **Docs site** via mdBook 0.5.3 (pinned, fetched via direct
  curl from `rust-lang/mdBook` releases - no third-party
  action). `book.toml` at repo root, `src = "docs"`,
  `docs/SUMMARY.md` maps the existing tree into five parts,
  `docs/introduction.md` is the docs-site landing
  (README stays GitHub-repo-focused). `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
  publishes to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- **User-facing install docs**. README gained "Which binary?" +
  "Install" sections with one command per path. `installing.md`
  restructured to put package paths first; build-from-source
  positioned as the developer path. `RELEASE.md` at the repo
  root documents the steps CI can't do (AUR SSH push,
  draft-publish review, pre-tag readiness checks).

**Conventions established (worth keeping)**:

- Bare semver tags (`0.14.1`, no `v` prefix); all pipelines pass
  the tag straight through.
- No top-level `LICENSE` file in v1 - the LGPL-3.0 text ships
  inline in `packaging/debian/copyright` (the form distros
  actually consume) + README links to gnu.org's canonical URL.

**One-time manual setup** before the first push to `main`: in
GitHub repo Settings -> Pages, set "Source" to "GitHub Actions"
so `docs.yml` can deploy.

**Stayed on the "Path to 1.0.0 distribution" parallel track**
(post-M15.8 polish, not gated on this milestone): Homebrew tap,
Snap, Nix flake, real apt repository, cross-build for macOS /
Windows (waits on platform-portability work first).

---

## M16 - I/O libraries and developer tooling

**Status:** done. Phase C: system libraries that touch the OS or do
significant compute, opened by a concurrency primitive (M16.0) that the
I/O libraries build on, then a developer-tooling trio (lint / profile /
test) and a run of self-contained data libraries. All sub-milestones
shipped; git history holds the full per-milestone specs.

### M16.0 - Lightweight concurrency

**Done.** `spawn { ... }` (block primary expression), `task of T` (new
compound kind), and the `task` library (`wait` / `poll` / `discard` /
`waitAll` / `waitAny`). Goroutine-backed but data-race-free by
construction: `snapshotForSpawn` deep-copies a two-frame globals+locals
snapshot at launch (tasks are the one carve-out from value semantics -
copies share the `TaskState` pointer). A per-run registry loud-fails
unobserved task errors at exit and bumps the exit code (a non-terminating
undiscarded spawn hangs at exit - the documented trade-off). `task.wait`
re-raises a body error at the wait site for `try`/`catch`; `waitAny` is
the runtime's only `reflect.Select`. The Makefile passes
`-stack-size=2mb -scheduler=tasks` to TinyGo. See
[concurrency.md](user-guide/concurrency.md), [task.md](libraries/task.md).

### M16.1 - `fs`

**Done.** Blocking filesystem I/O composed with `spawn` (no `*Async`
variants): whole-file `read`/`write`/`append` (String/Bytes), metadata
(`exists`/`isFile`/`isDir`/`stat` -> `fs.Stat`), directory ops with the
two-verb recursion split (`mkdir`/`mkdirAll`, `remove`/`removeAll`, plus
`rename`/`list`/`walk`), and buffered `fs.File` handles
(`open`/`readLine`/.../`close`; `eof` peeks one byte). Path- vs
handle-form verbs dispatch on first-arg kind; `fs.File` shares state
across copies (the handle carve-out from value semantics). See
[fs.md](libraries/fs.md).

### M16.2 - `net`

**Done.** TCP (`connect`/`listen`/`accept`/`readBytes`/`writeBytes`),
UDP (`listenUDP`/`sendTo`/`recvFrom`), and DNS
(`lookup`/`reverseLookup`); polymorphic `close`/`address` over three
handle registries. Blocking calls compose with `spawn`
(accept-loop-per-connection). Build-tag split: `jennifer-tiny` returns
friendly-error stubs (no netdev in TinyGo). See [net.md](libraries/net.md).

### M16.3 - `regex`

**Done.** RE2 (Go `regexp`, linear-time) over strings:
`matches`/`find`/`findAll`/`replace`/`split`/`escape`;
`regex.Match{text,start,end,groups,groupsNamed}` with rune indices and a
`start=-1` no-match sentinel; an implicit 128-entry LRU pattern cache.
Full surface in both binaries. See [regex.md](libraries/regex.md).

### M16.4 - `testing` (system-library primitives)

**Done.** The irreducible system-side surface a `.j` test framework needs:
`testing.run(name)` invokes a zero-arg user method via the new
`Interpreter.CallByName`, times it, and classifies every failure mode
into a `testing.Result`; `results`/`reset` manage a mutex-guarded
accumulator; `report` renders text / TAP / JUnit. The one place `exit` is
caught (at the Go level, so language `try`/`catch` still cannot). See
[testing.md](libraries/testing.md).

### M16.5 - Interpreter performance pass

**Done.** Five sub-milestones, user-visible behaviour unchanged: **.1**
shared-marker copy-on-write on compound Values (append-in-a-loop O(N^2)
-> amortised O(N)); **.2** parse-time lexical slot resolution
((Depth,Slot) coordinates + a `slots` slice, undefined/shadowing promoted
to parse-time errors); **.3** pooled + pre-resolved + slot-bound
method-call frames; **.4** namespaced-call / comparison / arg-bind /
root-cache fast paths; **.5** compile-time constant folding plus a
`Share()` scalar fast path. Numbers in [tinygo.md](technical/tinygo.md).

### M16.6 - Developer tooling: linting

**Done.** `jennifer lint` flags compile-legal-but-suspect patterns:
grouped IDs (**L0nn** source errors, always on / **L1nn** correctness /
**L2nn** style / **L3nn** lifecycle), `# lint-disable[-file]: IDS`
suppression, `--checks` / `.jennifer-lint` config, and human / JSON /
GitHub output (source errors render in the chosen format, so a JSON
pipeline stays valid); exit 0/1/2. `!tinygo`. See
[cli_lint.md](technical/cli_lint.md).

### M16.7 - Developer tooling: profiling

**Done.** `jennifer profile` attributes work to `.j` source positions
(what `go tool pprof` cannot): a statement profile (hit count +
self/cumulative wall-clock) and an `--allocs` value-copy profile; table /
pprof (hand-encoded gzipped protobuf) / Chrome-trace output; program
output goes to stderr so the profile owns stdout. `!tinygo`. See
[cli_profile.md](technical/cli_profile.md).

### M16.8 - Testing framework consolidation

**Done.** An assertion vocabulary on M16.4's primitives (`assertEqual`
... `assertThrows`, throwing `Error{kind:"assertion"}` at the call site),
`CallByNameWith`/`runWith` argument dispatch, and the `jennifer test`
subcommand (`test*` discovery or `--filter`, `setUp`/`tearDown`,
`--isolated` per-test subprocess, text/TAP/JUnit, exit 0/1/2). Builtins
can now raise a catchable Jennifer error via `interpreter.RaiseError`. See
[cli_test.md](technical/cli_test.md).

### M16.9 - `json`

**Done.** Hand-rolled RFC 8259 encode/decode onto the tagged-union Value
(no `encoding/json`, no reflect). `encode`/`encodePretty`/`decode`;
structs and `map of string to V` map to objects, `bytes` to base64,
numbers to `int` when integral else `float`. Also closed a type hole: a
generic collection (a fresh literal or decode result) is validated entry
by entry against the declared element type at every binding boundary.
Decode's return shape was later superseded by
[M16.16](#m1616---jsonvalue). See [json.md](libraries/json.md).

### M16.10 - `uuid`

**Done.** RFC 9562: `uuid.generate("v4")` (random) / `generate("v7")`
(time-ordered), the version tag a string argument (identifiers are
letters-only), plus `parse`/`isValid`/`version` and constant `NIL`.
Randomness draws from `math`'s shared seedable RNG (documented
non-crypto; swaps when M19 `crypto` lands). See [uuid.md](libraries/uuid.md).

### M16.11 - `compress`

**Done.** Byte-stream size reduction (distinct from `encoding`'s
representation codecs): `pack`/`unpack` for `"gzip"`/`"zlib"`/`"deflate"`
with an optional `"fast"`/`"default"`/`"best"` level, plus a streaming
`compress.Stream` handle. Go `compress/*`, TinyGo-clean. See
[compress.md](libraries/compress.md).

### M16.12 - `archive`

**Done.** tar / zip containers over `bytes` (no `fs`, value-semantic):
`pack`/`unpack` (verbs shared with `compress`) for
`"tar"`/`"zip"`/`"tar.gz"`; a bundle is a
`list of archive.Entry{name,data,mode,mtime}`. Go
`archive/tar`+`archive/zip`. See [archive.md](libraries/archive.md).

### M16.13 - `os.isTerminal`

**Done.** `os.isTerminal(stream)` (`"stdout"`/`"stderr"`/`"stdin"`) ->
bool, the gate for ANSI colour, via the character-device mode bit
(`os.ModeCharDevice`) - pure stdlib (keeps `x/term` CLI-scoped),
TinyGo-clean; an unstattable stream reports `false`. See
[os.md](libraries/os.md).

### M16.14 - `net` TLS

**Done.** `net.connectTLS(address)` (implicit TLS) and
`net.startTLS(conn)` (in-place STARTTLS upgrade), both yielding the
transport-agnostic `net.Conn`. Certificate verification is on by default,
with a `net.TLSOptions{skipVerify as bool, caCert as bytes}` opt-out. Go
`crypto/tls` on the `!tinygo` build (stubbed on `jennifer-tiny`). See
[net.md](libraries/net.md).

### M16.15 - `encoding` completion

**Done.** Filled out `encoding`: `toText`/`fromText` gained
`quoted-printable`, `base32`/`base32-hex`, `ascii85`, and `z85`; the full
ISO-8859-{1..16} / Windows-{1250..1258} single-byte codecs, generated
from the Unicode mapping files (`gen_codecs.go` -> `codecs_gen.go`) so
only `ascii`/`ebcdic` stay hand-written. Format and codec names are
exact-match (the normalisation layer was dropped as a strictness lift,
stance #2). See [encoding.md](libraries/encoding.md).

### M16.16 - `json.Value`

**Done.** The strict home for heterogeneous JSON without a language top
type: `json.decode` returns an opaque `json.Value` - the first
`KindObject` (the opaque sibling of `KindStruct`: discriminated by
`(namespace, name)`, minted only by a library, rejecting operators /
`[i]` / `.field`). `convert.typeOf` reports `"object"`,
`convert.objectType` the specific `"json.Value"`. Reads and non-mutating
writes share JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) addressing -
`typeOf`/`get`/`has`/`keys`/`length`/`as*`/`isNull` and
`map`/`list`/`set`/`insert`/`append`/`remove`/`move` (strict / no-vivify,
`-` end-marker), with node types in `list`/`map` vocabulary - and a
displayer hook renders a handle as its JSON. `json.decode`'s return type
changed (a pre-1.0 break) and the decoder's number grammar was tightened
to json.org. No `any` keyword (rationale in
[rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)). See [json.md](libraries/json.md).

**Phase D: higher-level and Jennifer-coded libraries (M17-M20).**

## M17 - Module system for Jennifer-coded libraries

Real modules so Jennifer-coded libraries get namespaces, scope, and
explicit exports. "Module" is the canonical term for a distributable
`.j` library (matching Python, ES2015, Rust). `include "x.j";` stays the
textual-splice form for composing one module out of several files;
`import "x.j" as x;` is the new cross-module boundary. Ships as four
dependency-ordered submilestones (M17.1 source tree and resolution,
M17.2 import statement and loader, M17.3 module scope and namespacing,
M17.4 exports and visibility); M18.x cannot start until all four land.

```jennifer
# points.j - a module
export def struct Point { x as int, y as int };

export func mid(a as Point, b as Point) {
    return Point{ x: ($a.x + $b.x) // 2, y: ($a.y + $b.y) // 2 };
}

func doubleCoord(v as int) { return $v * 2; }   # private: no export marker
```

```jennifer
# consumer.j
use io;
import "./points.j" as points;

def p as points.Point init points.Point{ x: 0, y: 10 };
io.printf("mid = %v\n", points.mid($p, points.Point{ x: 4, y: 6 }));
```

**Design basis** (the settled decisions the submilestones inherit;
turned-down alternatives live in
[rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)):

- `import` is a parser + interpreter feature, not a preprocessor splice
  like `include` (M17.2).
- Each module is its own resolution context: own `use` set, own
  namespace tables, own export table (M17.3).
- Modules are declarations-only, no mutable top-level state; `spawn`
  capture is unaffected because there is nothing mutable to capture
  (M17.3).
- One global `Error` (M13.2 stands); modules add distinctly-named error
  structs, never redefine `Error` (M17.3).
- Private by default; a leading `export` publishes a name. No
  `public`/`private` keyword (M17.4).
- Multi-file modules assemble via `include` behind one entry file; no
  directory-as-module, no cross-file re-export (M17.1).
- Modules need a filesystem; `jennifer-tiny` loads them where one
  exists, else fails with the normal search-path error (M17.1).

## M17.1 - Source tree and resolution

**Scope.** Where modules live on disk and how an import string resolves
to a file.

**Ships.**

- A top-level `modules/` directory for Jennifer-coded modules; system
  (Go-built) libraries stay in `internal/lib/*/`. Distro packaging ships
  modules to `/usr/share/jennifer/modules/` (FHS: read-only,
  arch-independent data), loadable without recompiling the interpreter.
- **Import paths are OS-independent.** The string is a *logical* path,
  always `/`-separated (like a URL, or the `.j` string literal itself),
  never the host separator - a `\` in an import string is a syntax error,
  not a Windows separator. The shape is classified on that logical string;
  the actual file is then located with `path/filepath`, so Windows `\`,
  drive letters, and mixed separators are handled by the Go stdlib at
  resolve time, not by the grammar. Three shapes, by the *leading* token:
  - `import "./f.j"` / `"../f.j"` - **local**: relative to the importing
    file's directory; no search path consulted.
  - `import "/abs/f.j"` - **absolute**: exactly that file, detected with
    `filepath.IsAbs` (so a Windows `C:/f.j` counts too), no search path.
    Absolute imports are inherently non-relocatable - prefer a `-I` search
    path for machine-specific locations.
  - `import "f.j"` - **module**: walk the search path (system module
    dir, then each `-I DIR` in order). The importing file's directory is
    never consulted. `-I DIR` values are OS-native paths (the user types
    them in a shell), so `\` and drive letters are fine there.
- Subdirectories: a `/` anywhere but the leading position is an ordinary
  path component, so all three shapes accept `sub/f.j`.
- Multi-file modules: one entry file (`modules/bigmod/bigmod.j`)
  `include`s its parts (subdirs allowed); the splice is one module scope
  and one export surface; the consumer imports only the entry file.
- sysmoddir resolution: `--sysmoddir` > `JENNIFER_SYSMODDIR` >
  compile-time default (baked via the Makefile codegen path, since
  TinyGo ignores `-ldflags -X`). Inspectable through `meta.SYSMODDIR`
  (resolved after argv/env, not a static Install-time const) and
  `jennifer version -v` (each layer tagged `cli`/`env`/`compile`).

**Decisions.**

- Path shapes are disjoint at the character level so a reader tells
  "local file" from "vetted module" without leaving the line;
  working-directory-first search is a supply-chain footgun (rejected.md,
  implicit fallback chain). System modules win over `-I`; `-I` adds
  names, never overrides.
- Duplicate module names across `-I` dirs (or `-I` vs system) are a hard
  error at load, naming both paths.
- `--sysmoddir` / `JENNIFER_SYSMODDIR` are validated at Run() (missing
  or non-dir refuses to start); the compile-time default is best-effort,
  so a fresh checkout with no installed tree still runs scripts that
  import nothing.
- Bare form (`import "sub/bigmod.j";`, no `as`) reserves the file stem
  (`bigmod`) as the prefix.
- `../` in a local import is allowed - the supply-chain rule targets the
  consumer's working directory, not navigation within an
  author-controlled tree.
- No directory-as-module and no cross-file re-export (rejected.md); no
  package versioning / upgrade / signing (explicit non-goal: the distro
  or `-I` places module versions, the interpreter picks what it finds).
- TinyGo: resolution needs `fs` (present under TinyGo). Hosted
  `jennifer-tiny` loads modules; an FS-less host fails with the ordinary
  ordered-search-path error. A build-time `embed.FS` bundle is a
  deferred future option, not M17.

**Acceptance.** A module in `modules/bigmod/bigmod.j` that `include`s
`sub/extra.j` imports and runs under both `jennifer` and `jennifer-tiny`
on a hosted target via each of the three path shapes; `--sysmoddir`,
`JENNIFER_SYSMODDIR`, and the compile-time default resolve in that
precedence and surface identically through `meta.SYSMODDIR` and
`jennifer version -v`; duplicate `-I` names and a missing named
sysmoddir both error at Run().

## M17.2 - Import statement and loader

**Scope.** The `import "..." as NAME;` statement end to end: pipeline
placement, one-time init, ordering, cycles, error surfacing.

**Ships.**

- Preprocessor stops rejecting `import` and passes its tokens through
  (as it already does for `use`); `include` stays a preprocessor splice.
  The two keywords diverge cleanly by pipeline stage.
- Parser gains a `ModuleImportStmt` node (path + optional alias),
  distinct from the `use`-backed `ImportStmt`.
- Interpreter gains a module loader + cache. Loading a module lexes,
  preprocesses, parses, resolves, and executes it once against a fresh
  module scope, keyed by a **canonical** resolved path (`filepath.Abs` +
  `Clean`, and case-folded on a case-insensitive filesystem like Windows /
  macOS) so that `Util.j` and `util.j` resolve to one module scope - the
  run-once guarantee and cycle detection both depend on the key being
  canonical, not on the string the importer happened to type.

**Decisions.**

- **Run-once.** A module inits exactly once per program run; later
  imports (any importer, any point) reuse the cached resolved AST and
  initialised namespace. Two aliases of one file share an instance; the
  same relative name from two directories are two modules (abspath key).
- **Init order is depth-first post-order.** A module fully inits before
  any module that imports it. Script imports A, A imports B, B imports C
  -> C, then B, then A, then the script body; each module's struct
  hoisting and `def const` initializers run once, on first reach.
- **Cycles are rejected; a module in a cycle never inits.** The loader
  tracks in-progress modules on the load stack; reaching an `import` of
  an in-progress module errors at load, before any initializer in the
  cycle runs, with `module cycle: A -> B -> C -> A` naming each edge. No
  Python-style partial init. Fix: factor a shared third module (Go's
  model). Mirrors the M10 include-cycle rejection.
- **Load-time errors are not catchable.** A `def const` initializer that
  throws during load fails the program at load, before the importer's
  body; `import` is a top-level declaration, not an expression, so
  `try`/`catch` cannot wrap it. Parse errors surface positioned in the
  imported file (path + line + col).
- `jennifer fmt` / `ast` / `tokens` preserve `import "..." as x;`
  textually, same as `include`.

**Acceptance.** A three-module chain inits in post-order exactly once
each (observable via a load-time `io.printf` in each `def const`
initializer); a re-import returns the cached instance without re-running
init; an A->B->C->A cycle errors at Run() naming every edge; a throwing
initializer fails at load and is not caught by a `try` around the
`import`; `jennifer fmt` round-trips an `import` line unchanged.

## M17.3 - Module scope and namespacing

**Scope.** What a module's top level may contain, how its names resolve,
and how it reaches other libraries and modules.

**Ships.**

- Per-module resolution context: each loaded module carries its own
  `nsPrefixes`, namespace tables, and private + export symbol tables in
  the module cache entry.
- Declarations-only top level. Exactly these forms; the three
  declaration forms take an optional leading `export`, the two import
  forms do not:
  - `def const NAME as TYPE init EXPR;` (export-able)
  - `def struct Name { ... };` (export-able)
  - `func name(...) { ... }` (export-able)
  - `use LIB [as ALIAS];`
  - `import "..." as NAME;`
- Consumer-side qualified resolution (`points.mid(...)`, `points.Point`)
  reuses the M10 namespacing machinery through the consumer's
  module-import table into the module's export table.

**Decisions.**

- **No mutable module state.** A mutable `def VAR ...;` at module top
  level errors, as does any free-standing top-level statement (bare
  expression, assignment, `if`/`while`/`for`/`repeat`). A `def const`
  initializer still runs once at load; "declarations-only" bounds
  statement forms, not initializer evaluation. Value-producing init is
  `export def const T init buildTable();` calling a private `func`.
- **`spawn` is unaffected.** With no mutable module state there is
  nothing new to capture; `snapshotForSpawn`'s two-frame model is
  unchanged and module constants (deep-immutable) are safe to reference.
- **`use` is not transitive.** A module's `use net;` gives the module
  `net.*`; the importer needs its own `use net;`. Prevents a module's
  implementation choices leaking into a consumer's namespace.
- **Bare type names resolve in the module's own type table.** Inside
  `points.j`, `func mid(a as Point, ...)` checks a value of identity
  `(points, Point)` against the module-local `Point`. A module names
  another module's type only through that module's prefix. Struct
  identity stays a `(namespace, name)` pair (M15.2).
- **One global `Error`.** M13.2's reserved `Error` is canonical across
  every module; user code never redefines it. Richer payloads are
  distinctly-named structs (`export def struct ParseError { ... };`);
  cross-module identity makes `a.ParseError` and `b.ParseError` distinct
  (rejected.md records the dropped per-module-`Error` idea).
- Scripts (run via `jennifer run`) keep top-level mutable `def` and
  free-standing statements - a script is a single execution context with
  no importer.

**Acceptance.** A mutable `def` or a free-standing statement at module
top level is a positioned parse error; a `def const` initializer runs
once at load; a module using `use net;` internally works while its
importer without `use net;` cannot call `net.*`; a struct made in a
module and passed back to a module `func` type-checks; a `spawn` body
calling a module `func` behaves identically to the serial call under
`-race`.

## M17.4 - Exports and visibility

**Scope.** Which top-level names cross the module boundary, and the
script-vs-module and test-overlay rules that follow.

**Ships.**

- `export` marker on top-level `def const` / `def struct` / `func`
  publishes the name; unmarked names are module-private. One marker, one
  direction.
- Referential-closure check: an exported struct field (or exported
  `func` parameter / return) whose type is a private struct errors at
  the export-annotation site.
- Cross-module struct identity `(module-prefix, name)` (extends M15.2).
- `MODULE_test.j` white-box test-overlay convention (pairs with M16.8
  `jennifer test`).

**Decisions.**

- **Private by default** (stance 2): the public API is the `export`-ed
  set, greppable in one pass; a forgotten marker stays internal (the
  fail-safe direction). No mandatory `public`/`private` keyword and no
  `public` synonym / standalone `private` marker (rejected.md).
- **Accessing a private name** from outside errors positioned at the
  call site (`foo.helper: 'helper' is not exported from module 'foo'`).
  No field-level visibility; an exported struct exports its whole shape.
- **Scripts vs modules by entry, not content.** `export` in a
  `jennifer run` script is a parse error ("script has no importers"); a
  module with zero exports loads fine and yields an empty namespace (any
  `NAME.x` at the importer errors as undefined). Promoting a script to a
  module is the deliberate "I now have a public API" moment.
- **Test overlays.** A co-located `MODULE_test.j` is spliced into
  `MODULE.j`'s scope *before* `parser.Resolve` runs over the combined
  file, so slot numbering covers both and the overlay reads private
  names by bare identifier. Black-box tests use `import "./MODULE.j";`
  instead. One overlay per module (Go's convention). Splicing after
  resolution would strand the overlay at `(-1, -1)` and force name-based
  fallback, so fold it in pre-resolve.

**Acceptance.** An unmarked helper is unreachable as `mod.helper` (with
the positioned error) while an `export`-ed name resolves; an exported
struct with a private-struct field errors at annotation; `export` in a
run script is a parse error; a module with no exports imports but every
`NAME.x` errors; a `MODULE_test.j` overlay reads `MODULE.j`'s private
names and runs under `jennifer test`. This submilestone touches parser
grammar (the `export` keyword), so it ships last; M17.1-M17.3 are
tooling, loading, and resolution.

## M17.5 - `ansi` (first reference module)

The first module built on the M17 module system - small, useful, pure
Jennifer, and a real dogfood of `import` / `export` / resolution.
Terminal styling as explicit string wrappers; escape-code generation is
pure string work, so no Go is needed.

- **Surface.** `ansi.color(s, name)` / `ansi.bgColor(s, name)`,
  `ansi.style(s, name)` (bold / dim / italic / underline / reverse),
  `ansi.rgb(s, r, g, b)` for truecolor, `ansi.strip(s)` to remove all
  escapes, plus convenience `ansi.red(s)` / `ansi.bold(s)` / ...
  shortcuts. `export`ed from a `modules/ansi.j`.
- **TTY-aware.** Gates styling on `os.isTerminal("stdout")`
  ([M16.13](#m1613---osisterminal)) so redirected output stays clean; a
  manual `ansi.enabled(flag)` override is available, and the module
  degrades to always-on if `os.isTerminal` is absent.
- **Why it is the reference module.** It exercises the whole module path
  end to end - a real `import`, `export`ed names, one system dependency
  (`use os;`) across the boundary - with code small enough to read in one
  sitting; a better M17 proof than a toy.
- **Not `printf` modifiers, not `io`.** Colour is a string wrapper, not
  I/O and not value formatting, so a `%s|color=` printf modifier is
  rejected in its favour ([technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)
  entry when it lands).
- **Acceptance.** `import`s and resolves as a module; wrapping composes
  and nests; `strip` reverses it; styling suppresses when
  `os.isTerminal` is false.

## M18.x - Jennifer-coded modules

Built atop the existing system libraries. Each one ships as a
Jennifer **module** under `modules/` (the directory introduced in
M17); none of them are compiled into the interpreter binary.
Sub-milestones in priority order:

- **M18.1 - `timezones`** - IANA-name + DST companion to the
  fixed-offset core in M15.5.2. A pure-Jennifer map of zone
  names to `time.Zone` values (with seasonal ranges where
  applicable) and a small resolver helper
  (`timezones.zoneFor(name, $t) -> time.Zone`) that picks the
  right offset for a given instant. A build-time script
  regenerates the map from the host's tzdata before shipping,
  so the data is auditable as source. Keeps zone policy out
  of the interpreter binary.
- **M18.2 - `http`** (client) - atop `net`. HTTPS needs net TLS
  ([M16.14](#m1614---net-tls)).
- **M18.3 -** (`json` promoted to a Go system library, **M16.9** -
  foundational and performance-sensitive enough to earn native speed.)
- **M18.4 - `csv`** - simple, useful early.
- **M18.5 - `yaml`, `toml`, `xml`, `markdown`, `pretty`** - one or more
  sub-milestones depending on scope when planned. `toml` maps tables to
  `map`, arrays to `list`, and datetimes to `time.Time`; `.ini` is
  deferred as an optional tiny module only if demand surfaces (no real
  standard, ambiguous quoting / typing).
- **M18.6 - `mail`** - SMTP / IMAP / POP3 clients plus MIME (RFC 5322
  headers, multipart, 7bit / 8bit / quoted-printable / base64 transfer
  encodings). **Pure Jennifer**: the protocols are line-oriented
  command/response state machines and MIME is header + boundary
  structure - exactly the text orchestration a `.j` module does well -
  with the heavy lifting delegated to system libraries. Two system
  prerequisites, because neither can be pure Jennifer:
  - **net TLS ([M16.14](#m1614---net-tls), system).** Mail is almost
    always encrypted (implicit TLS on 465 / 993 / 995, STARTTLS on
    587 / 143 / 110), and TLS is cryptographic - it must be the host's
    (`net.connectTLS` / `net.startTLS`), never interpreted `.j`.
  - **quoted-printable in `encoding`
    ([M16.15](#m1615---encoding-completion), system).** The MIME
    transfer codec, alongside the base64 the module also leans on.
  With those in place the `mail` module stays pure Jennifer: connection
  dialogue, header parse/build, MIME-tree assembly and walk, and
  address / date formatting.
- **M18.7 - `redis`** - a Redis client over `net`. RESP2 framing
  (`+OK`, `$len`, `*count`, `:int`, `-ERR`) parses cleanly in `.j`;
  commands go out as RESP arrays. Plaintext first (trusted network /
  localhost); `rediss://` TLS is a later add via net TLS
  ([M16.14](#m1614---net-tls)). `AUTH [user] password` is a plain
  command, so no `crypto` dependency. Typed per-command helpers
  (`get -> string`, `incr -> int`, `lrange -> list`) keep the common
  path fully typed; a generic `command(...)` returning the raw reply would
  use an opaque `redis.Reply` walked with accessors, the same pattern as
  `json.Value` ([M16.16](#m1616---jsonvalue)). No hard prerequisites
  (just `net`), so it can land ahead of `mail`.
- **M18.8 - `memcache`** - a client for the `memcached` server's text
  protocol (`set` / `get` / `delete` / `incr` / `decr`; replies
  `STORED` / `VALUE ... END`) over `net`. Pure Jennifer, plaintext
  (memcached rarely uses TLS); values are `bytes` / `string`. Named
  `memcache` for the client / protocol; it talks to a `memcached`
  daemon.

(A Jennifer-coded `testing` module used to sit here as M18.5
- assertion vocabulary, `setUp` / `tearDown` orchestration,
`--filter` / `--format` / `--isolated` CLI. All of that moved
down into [M16.8](#m168---testing-framework-consolidation)
because the split was primitives-in-Jennifer atop
primitives-in-Go, spending implementation weight on
abstraction rather than capability. What remained after M16.8
- `assertApproxEqual($a, $b, $tol)`, `assertMatchesRegex`
composing on M16.3, table-driven test helpers - was
docs-section-sized rather than module-sized, so it lives as a
usage-patterns section in
[docs/libraries/testing.md](libraries/testing.md) instead of
as a numbered milestone. M18.6 renumbered up to M18.5.)

## M19 - `crypto`

Symmetric and asymmetric primitives, key derivation,
crypto-grade random. System library; TinyGo-safe primitives
only. Hashes already shipped in M15.6.

- **Swap `uuid`'s random source.** `uuid` (M16.10) draws its v4 /
  v7 randomness from `math`'s shared non-crypto RNG (seedable,
  predictable - documented). When crypto-grade random lands here,
  repoint `uuidlib.randByte` at it so `uuid.v4` is unguessable; the
  change is one function, no surface change. Until then `uuid` must
  not be used for security tokens.

## M20 - `httpd`

Pure-Jennifer HTTP server atop `net`. Ships as a module under
`modules/httpd.j` (same packaging shape as the M18 modules), not
baked into the interpreter. The point where Jennifer becomes
useful for serving content. Depends on **M16.0 concurrency**
(per-connection handlers run in `spawn` blocks) and M16.2 `net`
(the underlying TCP listener).

---

**Phase E: embedding, WASM, and specialised domains (M21+).** Not
committed to a timeline; recorded so the design doesn't foreclose
them. Ordered by the size of the structural change each one is:
M21's `internal/` -> `pkg/` restructure is a single-repo refactor;
M22's WASM runtime brings in a whole new dependency; M23.x/M24+
are indefinite-in-count library families.

## M21 - Public interpreter API for third-party embedding

Extract the interpreter core out from under `internal/` and
expose a documented Go-side surface so external programs can
embed Jennifer. Today `internal/interpreter`,
`internal/parser`, `internal/lexer`, and `internal/lib/*` are
unreachable from any module that isn't `github.com/mplx/jennifer-lang`
- Go's `internal/` visibility rule is not a convention, it's
a compile-time barrier. No submodule / require / replace
workaround exists; embedding is impossible without a
restructure.

Ships ahead of M22's WASM runtime because a Go-side embedding
API is a strictly smaller change (repository restructure, no
new external dependency), it unblocks the most immediate
embedding scenarios (scripting slot in a Go host, LSP /
formatter tooling, test harnesses), and it does not foreclose
M22 - a WASM plugin surface can layer on the same `pkg/`
facade once Wazero (or similar) is in play.

**Concretely.** Add a `pkg/` top-level (working name; the
final path settles at start of M21):

- `pkg/interpreter` re-exports `Interpreter`, `Value`, error
  types, and the `Install(in *Interpreter)` registration API
  that every stdlib library already uses. The `internal/`
  packages stay as the implementation; `pkg/` is the stable
  facade with semver-covered surface once we ship 1.0.
- `pkg/lib/*` re-exports each shipped library (`convert`,
  `math`, `strings`, ...) so a host can install the ones it
  wants and leave out the rest. Non-breaking for the current
  CLI - `cmd/jennifer` picks up the same `Install` calls,
  just through `pkg/lib` shims instead of directly.
- Documented pluggable interfaces for the host-provided
  facilities the OS-touching libraries currently reach for:
  - `io.Writer` for `io.printf` output (already a
    `*Interpreter` field; formalize as an interface).
  - `io.Reader` for `io.readLine` / `io.readBytes` /
    `io.readChars` stdin.
  - `Clock` for `time.now()` / `time.local()` / `time.sleep`
    (the `nowFunc` / `sleepFunc` test hooks in
    `internal/lib/time` are the shape).
  - `Rand` for `math.rand*` / `lists.shuffle` (the shared
    random source).
  - Filesystem / network / process hooks left as future
    work - a host wanting those either installs the
    stdlib libraries as-is (accepting the Go `os` /
    `net` dependencies) or ships its own shims. A
    documented registration pattern is the deliverable;
    the shims themselves are per-host and out of scope
    for M21.

**Stdlib-backed defaults.** Each pluggable interface
carries a working default so `pkg/interpreter.New()`
plus `pkg/lib/io.Install(in)` produces a running
interpreter without every embedder wiring up seven
interfaces first. `Clock` defaults to Go's `time.Now`,
`Rand` to a `math/rand` source, `io.Writer` to
`os.Stdout`, `io.Reader` to `os.Stdin`. Hosts override
only what they need. A `no-os` embedder replaces every
default; a Slack-bot embedder swaps just `io.Writer`
for its outgoing-message pipe and leaves the rest.

**Boundary rules at the Install site.** Three explicit
error paths so hosts get loud, positioned failures
instead of subtle misbehaviour:

- **Duplicate library `Install` at the Go level is
  rejected**, mirroring how a duplicate `use NAME;`
  errors at the Jennifer level (M10 rule, lifted). A
  host installing `pkg/lib/math` and then its own
  shim that also claims the `math` namespace fails at
  the second `Install` call, not silently overlaid.
- **`Install` and pluggable-interface setters are
  frozen once `Run()` starts.** Attempts to call
  `Install`, `SetClock`, `SetOut`, or friends after
  the interpreter has begun executing produce a
  positioned "cannot configure interpreter mid-run"
  error at the Go call site. The interpreter can then
  trust its host bindings for the rest of the run
  without defensive re-checks.
- **Host implementations are trusted at the interface
  boundary.** The interpreter uses whatever `Clock.Now()`
  or `Rand.Int63()` returns without validation - a
  broken host implementation is the host's problem, not
  the interpreter's. Stated so hosts don't expect
  defensive checks that aren't there and so downstream
  bug reports are triaged to the correct side of the
  API boundary.

**Non-goals.**
- A hosted no-`os` build target. Even after M21, the
  shipping stdlib libraries lean on Go's `os` / `net` /
  `time` packages. A truly bare-metal or `no-os` embedding
  can only use the pure-value libraries (`convert`, `math`,
  `strings`, `lists`, `maps`, `hash`, `crc`, `encoding`,
  `regex`) plus whatever host-provided shims the embedder
  wires up. That's a design constraint on the embedder, not
  a milestone on Jennifer's side.
- Semver freezing the public API. Jennifer stays pre-1.0
  through M21; the milestone documents what's exported and
  how libraries plug in, but breaking changes to that
  surface remain allowed until 1.0.0.

**Motivation.** Third-party embedding has multiple concrete
consumers already imagined: scripting-language slot in a Go
application, tooling that needs direct AST / interpreter
access (LSP, formatter integrations, syntax highlighters),
test harnesses that want to drive `.j` programs from Go,
config-DSL runtimes, plugin systems for game engines and
similar. None of them require an OS-free build; all of them
need the `internal/` -> `pkg/` restructure.

The `Install` pattern already works this way - every stdlib
library is a `pkg.Install(in)` call. The missing piece is
visibility, plus documented hooks for the pieces of host
state currently exposed only as package-level test vars.

## M22 - WASM runtime embedding

Wazero or similar inside the interpreter binary. TinyGo-size
cost evaluated honestly before commitment. Without M22, no WASM
libraries.

## M23.x - WASM libraries

If M22 ships, sandboxed plugins via `use wasm:libname;`. Each
library a sub-milestone.

## M24+ - Specialised domains

Each domain its own milestone with sub-milestones as needed:

- **ML.**
  - **M24.1 - `stats`** - descriptive statistics over
    `list of int|float`: mean, median, mode, variance, stddev,
    percentile, min / max / sum, correlation. Pure-value,
    TinyGo-clean; the highest-value, simplest piece, so first.
  - **M24.2 - `linalg`** - vectors as `list of float` (dot, norm,
    cross, scale, add / sub) and matrices as `list of list of float`
    (matmul, transpose, determinant, inverse, solve, identity).
    Algorithms implemented directly - no `gonum`, too large a
    dependency. Matrices stay `list of list of float` for v1
    (idiomatic and value-semantic); a Go-backed matrix handle is the
    noted future escape hatch when big-matrix performance demands it.
  - **M24.3 - ML primitives** - atop `stats` / `linalg`, when demand
    surfaces.
- **Bioinformatics.** Sequence alignment (Smith-Waterman,
  Needleman-Wunsch), FASTA/FASTQ parsers, molecule structures.
- **Sandbox.** Restricted-capability execution.

Ordered when demand surfaces. WASM libraries (M23.x) may cover
some of this space first.

## Path to 1.0.0 distribution (parallel track)

The core CI + release + packaging items that used to live here
were promoted into M15.8 (the last step before Phase C). What
stays on this parallel track is the post-M15.8 polish - items
that can land any time and don't block any milestone:

- **Homebrew tap** for macOS users.
- **Snap** package.
- **Nix flake** / Nix package.
- **Cross-build for macOS / Windows.** Waits on the
  platform-portability work in the Long-horizon list; ships as
  soon as that lands.
- **Real apt repository** (replacing the "GitHub Release
  artifact" install of the M15.8 `.deb`) if user demand
  warrants the maintenance.
- **Snap / Flatpak**, **AppImage**, or any other Linux
  distribution format Jennifer users actually ask for.

Each of these ships when there's user demand and a maintainer
willing to keep it green; they're not blocking anything.

---

## Long horizon (recorded, not scheduled)

- **Cross-platform support.** Today Jennifer targets Linux only.
  Windows and macOS are planned. When touching filesystem, paths,
  line endings, or process behavior, prefer portable stdlib
  helpers (`path/filepath`, not hardcoded `/`); avoid Linux-only
  assumptions.
- **`encoding` - the harder codecs.** The single-byte character codecs and
  binary-to-text formats all shipped (M16.15); the deferred remainder,
  picked up only when a real program needs one: variable-width Asian
  encodings (`Shift-JIS`, `Big5`, `GB2312`, `GBK`, `GB18030`, `EUC-JP`,
  `EUC-KR`) - each a state machine with variant / ambiguity edge cases, a
  whole milestone apiece; `UTF-16` / `UTF-16LE` / `UTF-16BE` / `UTF-32` (BOM,
  surrogate pairs, endianness); and `UTF-7` (mail-transport - though
  `quoted-printable` already shipped as a general codec).
- **FCGI.** `use FCGI as web;` library when `net` and `httpd`
  mature. Lets Jennifer host CGI / FastCGI workloads end-to-end.
- **Inline assembler.**
- **Binary AST cache (`.jc` files).** Pre-parsed loading for big
  programs and embedded scripting hosts. Its own milestone when
  it lands - file-format design, versioning, and TinyGo-safe
  serialization are enough work to merit dedicated treatment. The
  text JSON form via `jennifer ast` is the placeholder until then.
  Deferred from M5.
- **Profiler: max-call-depth metric.** Have `jennifer profile` track
  Jennifer call depth (bump in `evalCall`, drop on return) and report
  the max reached, per source position and overall. Names stack-limit
  problems directly - the recursion-depth-vs-`-stack-size` headroom
  that the recursive `fib` in `examples/benchmark.j` exercises on
  `jennifer-tiny`. Small and additive to the existing hit-count /
  wall-clock / `--allocs` collector; deferred because stack limits are
  diagnosable by hand today. Heap-per-position stays out of scope
  (`--allocs` already proxies copy churn; true RSS needs
  `runtime.ReadMemStats` sampling, coarse under TinyGo).
- **`tinygo_devtools` build tag.** The dev subcommands (`tokens` /
  `ast` / `fmt` / `lint` / `profile` / `test`) are `!tinygo` for binary
  *size*, not compatibility - they are TinyGo-clean Go. A
  `//go:build !tinygo || tinygo_devtools` constraint (stub as
  `tinygo && !tinygo_devtools`) plus a `make build-tinygo-dev` target
  would let them run under the actual TinyGo runtime - e.g. to
  `profile` a TinyGo-specific perf or stack issue in situ. Pairs with
  the depth metric above: together they are "TinyGo runtime
  introspection." Deferred - build-tag complexity across ~6 files and a
  larger dev-tiny binary, for a diagnostic reached for only
  occasionally.
- **Build-time library selection.** Choose which system (Go) libraries
  are baked into a binary at compile time. Motivated by `jennifer-tiny`
  size (an embedded target needing only `io` + `math` shouldn't carry
  `net` / `regex` / `hash`) and by opt-in niche Go libraries that don't
  merit defaulting. The install point is already consolidated - every
  entry path (`run` / `repl` / `profile` / `test` and the test
  harnesses) calls `internal/stdlib.InstallAll`, so a library is one
  line there - and that is the seam a build-tag scheme would cut along:
  gate each entry behind `//go:build lib_net` (or a `minimal` / `full`
  profile) and grow `make build-minimal` / `make build TAGS=...`,
  exactly like the existing `!tinygo` dev-tool split. **Compile-time
  only** - Go's `plugin` package is Linux/macOS-only and unsupported by
  TinyGo, and dynamic linking contradicts `jennifer-tiny`'s
  no-hosted-runtime goal, so PHP-style loadable `.so` extensions are
  out. Two caveats to design for: (1) a trimmed build breaks the "any
  `.j` runs on any binary" portability promise (`use net;` becomes a
  runtime error), so the default build stays full and trimmed builds are
  an explicit opt-out - ideally with a `meta`-level "is library X
  present?" query for graceful degradation; (2) CI grows a couple of
  profiles (default / minimal), not 2^N. Complementary to, not a
  substitute for, the M17 module system: `.j`-level extensibility
  (community / uncommon libraries writable in Jennifer) is M17's job with
  zero binary cost; build-time selection is only for the curated Go-level core.
- **Relational databases (`sql`).** Postponed to M20+, pending a design
  discussion. A system library - a storage engine and SQL planner can't
  be interpreted, and wire-protocol auth needs crypto - driver-agnostic
  over Go's `database/sql`, SQLite first, then MySQL / PostgreSQL;
  standard-Go only, stubbed on `jennifer-tiny`. The questions that gate
  it: the SQLite driver (cgo `mattn/go-sqlite3`, which breaks static /
  cross-compile / TinyGo, vs pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite`, multi-MB);
  whether to accept the first heavyweight dependency in the library
  layer (a break from "libraries stay dependency-free") and, if so, gate
  it as a build-tag opt-in (per the note above); and the result-row
  shape - an opaque `sql.Row` accessor type mirroring `json.Value`
  (M16.16) vs a typed struct via the deferred map-to-struct conversion.
  Values bind only
  through `?` placeholders (injection safety). Contrast the
  text-protocol stores redis / memcache (M18.7 / M18.8), which are pure
  Jennifer over `net` and need none of this.
- **Explicit map-to-struct conversion.** A spelled-out, validating way to
  turn a `json.Value` object (or a homogeneous `map of string to T`) into
  a typed struct - the sanctioned counterpart to the *rejected* implicit
  coercion (see [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)). Deferred
  from the M16.x line: once JSON is destructured through `json.Value`
  accessors, the by-hand rebuild covers the need, so a one-call form is a
  convenience, not a blocker. Two candidate shapes, decided on consistency
  not brevity - a `convert.toStruct($map, "Point")` library call (a
  two-arg, stringly-typed outlier in the otherwise one-arg `convert.toX`
  family, or else not self-contained if it reads the binding's declared
  type) versus a `Point{ ..$map }` struct-literal spread (names its type
  statically, at the cost of new literal syntax). Either way strict: every
  declared field present with a matching type, recursing into nested
  structs / lists / maps, value-semantic, no partial fills or defaults.
- **`io.lines() -> list of string`.** Slurp the whole stdin into a
  list. Additive on top of the streaming `readLine()` + `eof()`
  idiom; nice-to-have for tiny scripts, not blocking. Deferred from
  M7.
- **i18n.** Locale-aware case folding, collation, number / date
  formatting, BiDi. Gated on the CLDR-data binary-size question
  (likely an optional library shipped after the M19 WASM runtime
  so locale tables aren't baked into every build).
- **Host-embedding API.** *Promoted to a numbered milestone -
  see [M21](#m21---public-interpreter-api-for-third-party-embedding).*
- **Advanced scheduling knobs.** CPU affinity, work-stealing
  pool sizing, NUMA awareness, `GOMAXPROCS`-equivalent runtime
  tuning. Runtime-config surface for the M16.0 spawn scheduler,
  not new language features. Ships when a real use case forces
  it (the M16.0 default - "let Go's scheduler decide" -
  handles every workload we've imagined so far).
- **Performance & memory.** Interpreter-internal optimizations
  that preserve stance #5 (value semantics) at the user level:
  copy-on-write for lists / maps / bytes / structs (share
  underlying storage until a write splits it), per-frame arena
  allocation, and read-only slice views (`xs[1..5]` as a
  non-owning window that errors on assignment). Strictly
  optimizations - no user-visible aliasing or mutation rules
  change. Stance-breaking variants (mutable references,
  interior mutability, shared mutable state) are turned down in
  [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md#references-interior-mutability-shared-mutable-state).
  Best landed post-M22 once the language is settled and the
  interpreter doesn't churn under it.
