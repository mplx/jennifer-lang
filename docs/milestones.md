# Jennifer - Milestones

Development is split into milestones. Each milestone produces a *working*
interpreter that runs a strictly larger subset of the language.

---

## M1 - End-to-end MVP

**Status:** done.

Smallest vertical slice that proves the pipeline (source → tokens →
preprocessed tokens → AST → result):

- Types: `int`, `string`
- `def x as int init 5;`, `$var` references, method defs (zero-arg, top
  level), `import "file.j";`, `use io;`, single-arg `printf`
- Arithmetic `+ - * / %` on ints; comments `#` and `/* */`
- Source-context caret in error messages
- Golden-file integration test and TinyGo build verified

**Exit criterion:** `./jennifer run examples/hello.j` prints `42`.

---

## M2 - Types, constants, scoping, control flow

**Status:** done.

Rounds out the "ordinary" feature set:

- New types `float`, `null`, `bool` with literals `3.14`, `null`, `true`,
  `false`
- Uninitialized `def x as T;` gives `T`'s zero value
- `def const NAME as TYPE init VALUE;` (reassignment is an error)
- Nested block scoping; inner scopes cannot redeclare visible names
- Assignment statement `$x = EXPR;`
- Comparison `< > <= >= ==`, `+` for string concat, `int`↔`float`
  promotion
- Escape parsing in `'...'` strings (previously only `"..."`)
- Control flow: `if`/`elseif`/`else`, `while`, `for`, all requiring
  `bool` conditions (no implicit truthiness)

---

## M3 - Methods with parameters and return values

**Status:** done.

- `func name(a as int, b as string) { ... }` with typed parameters,
  by-value argument passing, call-site arity + type checks
- `return;` and `return EXPR;`; recursion works
- `sprintf` and format verbs `%d %f %s %t %v %%` for both `printf` and
  `sprintf`
- The omnibus `stdlib` retired in favor of topic-based libraries; `io`
  is the first.

---

## M4 - Polish & ergonomics

**Status:** done.

- Logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` (word-based, short-circuit)
- Unary minus
- Python-3 division: `/` always returns `float`; new `div` keyword for 
  floor division (`//` is taken by line comments)
- Floats always display with a decimal (`5.0`, not `5`) so the type
  stays visible
- New libraries (all `use`-gated): [`convert`](libraries/convert.md),
  [`math`](libraries/math.md), [`strings`](libraries/strings.md)
- Interpreter gained `RegisterConst` so libraries can expose constants
  (`PI`, `E`).

---

## M5 - Interpreter improvements

**Status:** done.

- **Cross-file error sources** - errors raised inside an imported `.j`
  display the line from the imported file. See
  [technical/interpreter.md > Errors and positions](technical/interpreter.md#errors-and-positions-cross-file).
- **REPL** - `jennifer repl`, persistent globals/methods/imports across
  inputs, multi-line input via brace balancing, expression results
  printed. See [technical/cli_repl.md > REPL](technical/cli_repl.md#repl-cmdjenniferreplgo).
- **REPL line editor** - cursor keys, Home/End, word motions, Ctrl+W /
  Ctrl+U / Ctrl+K, in-memory history (Up/Down), Ctrl+C cancel. Non-TTY
  stdin falls back to plain line reading. See
  [technical/cli_repl.md > Line editor](technical/cli_repl.md#line-editor-cmdjenniferlineeditgo-cmdjenniferhistorygo).
- **Auto-loaded `core` library** - new library kind, pre-imported at
  startup; writing `use core;` is a runtime error. Contents:
  `JENNIFER_VERSION` (a `git describe`-derived build-version constant)
  and `len` (polymorphic over strings now; lists/maps in M6). `len`
  moved here from `strings`. (M15.4 later promoted `len` to a
  language built-in and deleted `core`; see M15.4 for the
  migration.) Version injection details at
  [technical/cli.md](technical/cli.md#version-injection).
- **Formatter** - `jennifer fmt` re-emits canonical source per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md). Token-level walker so file imports and
  user-written parentheses survive. See
  [technical/cli_fmt.md > Formatter](technical/cli_fmt.md#formatter-cmdjenniferfmtgo).
- **Inspection subcommands** - `jennifer tokens <file>` dumps the lexer
  output; `jennifer ast <file>` dumps the preprocessed AST as JSON.
  See [technical/cli_inspect.md > Inspection](technical/cli_inspect.md#inspection-tokens-and-ast).
- **Underscore-in-constants** - constant names became `[A-Z]+(_[A-Z]+)*`,
  enabling `MAX_RETRIES` and the `JENNIFER_VERSION` rename. See
  [technical/lexer.md > Identifier rule](technical/lexer.md#identifier-rule).
- **Documentation overhaul** - `docs/technical.md` split into
  `docs/technical/<topic>.md`; `docs/lib_*.md` moved to
  `docs/libraries/`; new `docs/user-guide/style-guide.md`.

---

## M6 - Lists and maps

**Status:** done.

Two new compound types - `list` and `map` - plus the strings library
functions deferred until compound types existed.

- **Syntax**: `def xs as list of int init [1, 2, 3];`,
  `def m as map of string to int init {"a": 1};`. Index read/write
  `$xs[i]`, `$m["k"]`, chains `$g[i][j]`. Iteration via
  `for (def x in $coll) { ... }` (new keyword `in`). New tokens
  `[ ] :` and keywords `list`, `map`, `of`, `to`, `in`.
- **Semantics**: value-typed (copy on assignment and on
  function-parameter binding; no aliasing); `const` is deep
  (`$NUMS[0] = ...` is a runtime error if `NUMS` is `const`);
  out-of-bounds list reads/writes and missing map keys are positioned
  runtime errors; map iteration is insertion-order deterministic.
- **Type system**: `parser.Type` became a recursive struct
  (`Element`, `KeyType`, `ValType` `*Type` slots), so nesting like
  `list of list of int` falls out without depth cap. 3+ levels is a
  documented code smell.
- **Stdlib**: `core.len` extended to lists and maps; `core.has(m, key)`
  for membership tests; `strings.split`, `strings.chars`,
  `strings.join` finished.
- **Tooling**: formatter handles `[...]` / `{...}` per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md) (no inner padding, space after `,`/`:`,
  block-vs-map disambiguation via a small brace stack); AST JSON
  emitter handles `ListLit`, `MapLit`, `IndexExpr`, `IndexAssignStmt`,
  `ForEachStmt`.

See [user-guide/types-and-values.md > Lists and maps](user-guide/types-and-values.md#lists-and-maps) for
the user-facing tour, and
[technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) /
[technical/interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md) for the
implementation contract.

## M7 - printf modifiers, stdin input, comment/division swap

**Status:** done.

A breaking syntax change to free up `//` for integer division and to
allow shebangs, the long-promised format-verb modifier system, and
the first stdin-reading builtins.

- **Comments and integer division** (**BREAKING**). Line comments
  moved from `//` to `#`, freeing `//` for floor division (Python 3
  shape). `div` keyword removed. A Jennifer file can now begin with
  `#!/usr/bin/env -S jennifer run`.
- **`(s)printf` format-verb modifiers.** Each format verb except `%v`
  accepts a pipe-separated, order-independent flag list:
  `%verb[|key=value]*`. Modifiers shape *presentation* only - data
  transformations (`case=upper` on strings, markdown rendering, etc.)
  are explicitly out of scope; libraries do that work. Verbs gained:
  `pad`/`max`/`align`/`mode` (`%s`); `pad`/`fill`/`align`/`base`/
  `sign`/`group`/`sep` (`%d`); `prec`/`trim`/`sci`/`pad`/`align`/
  `sign` (`%f`); `case` (`%t`); shared `null=empty|null|literal(...)`
  across all four typed verbs. `%v` deliberately takes none.
- **Format-string breaking change.** `|` immediately after a verb
  now starts a modifier list. Pre-M7 strings with `|` as a literal
  separator (`"%d|%d"`) need either a different separator or the
  `||` escape (parallels `%%`).
- **`io` stdin input.** New builtins `readLine()`,
  `readLine(prompt)`, `eof()` - one-line-at-a-time reads with an
  explicit EOF predicate (`while (not eof()) { ... }`). Refuses
  inside the REPL since the line editor owns stdin.
- **Internals.** Builtin signature changed from
  `func(out io.Writer, args)` to `func(ctx BuiltinCtx, args)` so
  stdin and the REPL flag are plumbed symmetrically with stdout.
  Mechanical refactor across the ~30 existing builtins.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - full modifier and input reference.
- [technical/lexer.md](technical/lexer.md) and
  [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - the comment / division
  syntax change.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - what the modifier
  system deliberately doesn't do (data transformations, `%a`
  aggregate, `null=sql`/`null=skip`) and why the literal-pipe
  lookahead alternative was turned down.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Builtins and libraries](technical/interpreter.md#builtins-and-libraries) - the `BuiltinCtx` signature.

---

## M8 - System library namespacing

**Status:** done.

A hybrid namespace model so domain libraries can ship without
polluting the bare-name pool, plus the first real namespaced
library (`os`) so the machinery has a non-synthetic exercise.

- **Hybrid model.** Essential libraries (`io`, `convert`, `math`,
  `strings`, auto-loaded `core`) stay flat - their builtins are
  bare names. Domain libraries register through a new namespaced
  API (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) and are
  addressed by `prefix.name(...)` / `prefix.NAME`. The library's
  name doubles as the namespace prefix.
- **Qualified calls and constants.** New AST nodes
  `QualifiedCallExpr` and `QualifiedConstRefExpr`; parsed as
  `IDENT "." IDENT` (then `(` decides). Lookup is keyed by
  `(namespace, name)` and gated by `use lib;`.
- **`use NAME as ALIAS;` aliasing.** Optional `as` clause on
  `use`. Rename-not-addition: after `use bio as b;` only `b.`
  resolves, `bio.foo()` errors with a "did you mean `b`?" hint;
  the canonical name `bio` is freed for ordinary identifier use.
  Matches Python's `import foo as bar`. Aliasing is rejected for
  flat libraries (`use math as m;` errors as meaningless).
- **Namespace prefix is a reserved identifier.** After bare
  `use bio;`, `func bio() {}` errors with `shadows imported
  namespace 'bio'`. After `use bio as b;`, only `b` is reserved.
- **No migration.** The change is purely additive; all five flat
  essentials continue to work unchanged.
- **Demo library `os` (minimal slice).** First namespaced
  library: `os.platform() -> string`, `os.getEnv(name) -> string`,
  `os.JENNIFER_LF`, `os.JENNIFER_OS`. Two functions plus two
  constants - enough to exercise namespaced zero-arg calls,
  namespaced calls with arguments, namespaced constants, and
  aliasing end-to-end. Expands in M15.1.

See:
- [libraries/os.md](libraries/os.md) - the shipping demo library.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - flat vs namespaced
  policy and the rule for library authors.
- [user-guide/imports.md > Namespaced libraries and aliasing](user-guide/imports.md#namespaced-libraries-and-aliasing) -
  user-facing reference for `use NAME [as ALIAS];` and qualified
  calls.
- [user-guide/style-guide.md > Namespaced calls](user-guide/style-guide.md#namespaced-calls) -
  spacing convention around `.`.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF for
  `qualifiedCall` / `qualifiedConstRef` and the `use ... as ...`
  shape; AST table entries for the new nodes.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Namespaced libraries (M8)](technical/interpreter.md#namespaced-libraries-m8) -
  registration API, `nsPrefixes` / `nsAliasedAway` resolution
  tables, no-shadowing rule for namespace prefixes.

---

## M9 - Collection operations

**Status:** done.

Two new namespaced libraries cover the M6-deferred list/map
manipulation helpers, a small append sugar shortens the common
write pattern, and two follow-on breaking changes tidy up the
flat-vs-namespaced split.

- **`lists` library** (`use lists;`, namespaced). `lists.push`,
  `lists.pop`, `lists.first`, `lists.last`, `lists.head`,
  `lists.tail`, `lists.reverse`, `lists.sort`, `lists.contains`,
  `lists.concat`, `lists.slice`. Non-mutating - every function
  returns a new list. `sort` accepts numeric, string, or bool
  elements (mixed int/float promotes; other mixes error);
  comparator-based sort is deferred until methods are first-class.
- **`maps` library** (`use maps;`, namespaced). `maps.keys`,
  `maps.values`, `maps.has`, `maps.delete`, `maps.merge`. Same
  shape. `maps.delete` of a missing key errors (strict at
  boundaries, matching `$m[missing]`); `maps.merge` layers the
  second arg over the first.
- **Sugar: `$xs[] = item;`** - write-only target meaning "just past
  the end of the list". Equivalent to
  `$xs = lists.push($xs, item);`. Reads of `$xs[]` and chained
  forms (`$xs[0][]`) are parse errors; non-list targets error at
  runtime. New AST node `AppendStmt`.
- **BREAKING:** `has()` moved from `core` to `maps` as
  `maps.has(m, key)`. Bare `has(...)` callers now need
  `use maps;` and the qualified form. `has` was the only
  non-polymorphic name in core; `len` stays because it genuinely
  spans string / list / map.
- **BREAKING:** `strings` library moved from flat to namespaced.
  `upper(s)` → `strings.upper(s)`, `contains(s, sub)` →
  `strings.contains(s, sub)`, etc. across all 15 functions.
  `use strings;` itself is unchanged. The M8 library-author rule
  named exactly these collision-prone verbs (`contains`, `split`,
  `replace`, `join`); acting on it now keeps callers off the wrong
  shape before more libraries arrive. After M9 the remaining flat
  libraries are `io`, `convert`, `math`, and auto-loaded `core`.

See:
- [libraries/lists.md](libraries/lists.md) /
  [libraries/maps.md](libraries/maps.md) - function reference for
  each new library.
- [libraries/strings.md](libraries/strings.md) - now namespaced
  (M9 migration note at top).
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - updated flat-vs-namespaced
  catalog and the library-author rule.

  user-facing reference.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF and AST entry
  for `AppendStmt`.

---

The next phase splits into four arcs after two architectural
prerequisites: M10 lands the namespace-first library architecture
that the rest of the standard library will be built on; Phase A
(M11-M13) finishes the language so libraries have something to
stand on; M14 closes the lexer-side gap (`fmt` losing comments
and shebangs) so the first wave of struct-using libraries can
ship with doc-comments intact; Phase B (M15.x) ships the
foundational libraries that every Jennifer program needs,
finishing with **M15.8 - the first public release** (CI, prebuilt
binaries, .deb / pacman / AUR packaging); Phase C (M16.x) ships
I/O libraries on top of the now-released foundation; Phase D
(M17-M20) ships the higher-level ecosystem (Jennifer-coded
libraries, the module system that unblocks them, crypto, a
server). Everything beyond a 1.0.0 - embedding, WASM, and
specialised domains - lives in the
[beyond-1.0.0 idea collection](horizon.md).

The library milestones use sub-numbering (M15.1, M15.2, ...) so
each library ships and is reviewed independently. This is the
first time we use sub-milestones; the practice is justified
because each library is small enough to land in a single sitting
once the language foundation is in place.

---

## M10 - Namespace-first library architecture

**Status:** done.

A pre-language-completion API-shape correction: every library is
now namespaced, with bare-name globals reserved as a narrow
`core`-only exception. Small implementation surface, large API
shape; pre-1.0 is the window for this kind of change.

- **BREAKING:** `io`, `math`, `convert` migrate to
  namespaced-only. `printf(x)` → `io.printf(x)`,
  `sqrt(x)` → `math.sqrt(x)`, etc. The "io is special, keep
  it flat" alternative was considered and rejected at kickoff
  to keep a uniform "every call carries its library name"
  rule. `strings`, `lists`, `maps`, `os` were already
  namespaced (M9/M8).
- **BREAKING:** `convert`'s four conversion callees are renamed
  to `convert.toInt`, `convert.toFloat`, `convert.toString`,
  `convert.toBool` so they don't collide with the type
  keywords (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`); `convert.typeOf`
  keeps its name. The `to`-prefix also reads as English
  ("convert to int") at the call site.
- **BREAKING:** file-splice keyword `import` → `include`.
  `include "x.j";` is the textual splice; the `import`
  keyword is reserved for the M17 module system and produces
  a migration-hint error today. Mixing-mistake diagnostics
  updated.
- **BREAKING for embedders:** registration API renamed.
  `Register` / `RegisterConst` → `RegisterGlobal` /
  `RegisterGlobalConst`, making their role explicit ("expose
  this name globally"). The namespaced API
  (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) keeps
  its name and is the recommended default. Per-library
  storage (`globalFnsByLib`, `globalConstsByLib`) so two
  libraries with the same global name can no longer silently
  overwrite each other at Install time; the resolution map
  is populated by `processImports` when a library activates.
- **`math` absorbs the planned non-crypto random helpers**:
  `math.rand()`, `math.randInt(lo, hi)`, `math.randSeed(n)`.
  Three functions don't justify their own library under the
  new threshold (next bullet); pseudo-random fits `math`'s
  pure-numeric charter. The crypto-grade variant still ships
  in M20.1 `crypto`. The originally planned M14.2 `random`
  library is removed.
- **`core` is the only library publishing bare-name globals.**
  `len` and `JENNIFER_VERSION` only - no `core.len` /
  `core.JENNIFER_VERSION` qualified form, because shipping the
  same name two ways violates stance #1. `core` is the
  auto-loaded escape hatch, and its asymmetric exposure is
  the whole point.
- **Three globals-publishing rules in `processImports`**, all
  forward-looking (inert today since `core` is the only
  globals-publishing library and can't be `use`d):
  1. Duplicate `use` of a globals-publishing library is
     rejected (`library 'X' already in scope`); REPL no-ops a
     repeat.
  2. `use X as Y;` where `X` has globals but no namespaced
     names is rejected as meaningless.
  3. Two active libraries publishing the same global name are
     rejected at the second `use`
     (`library "B" collides with already-active library "A"
     on global "VER"`). The pre-M10 flat-only-alias-meaningless
     check is removed for the general case but kept as rule 2.
- **Library-author guidance updated.** The
  `docs/libraries/index.md` "flat vs namespaced" framing is
  retired; the new policy is "every library is namespaced;
  only `core` ships globals via `RegisterGlobal`." The
  "deserves its own library" threshold is raised from M8's
  "3+" to **"5+ functions or constants"**: anything smaller
  folds into the most-related existing library. The non-crypto
  random helpers (3 functions) are the first case the new rule
  caught.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md),
  [libraries/math.md](libraries/math.md),
  [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md) - migrated library
  references.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - retired
  flat-vs-namespaced framing; new library-author policy and
  5+ threshold.
- [user-guide/imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) - `use` and
  `include` keyword reference; namespaced-call and aliasing
  rules.
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `convert.toInt` / `convert.toFloat` example placement in the
  "explicit conversions" section.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - "Methods
  on structs" (M14.3 trigger; recorded here in M10's wake
  because M10's review touched the same call-shape question)
  and other related rejected alternatives.

No new language features land here - that's M11.

---

**Phase A: language completion (M11-M13).** These three milestones
close the biggest daily-use gaps and add the foundational types every
later library needs.

## M11 - Control-flow completion

**Status:** done.

Closes the biggest daily-use gap in the language and rounds out the
printf modifier table at the same time. Five new keywords (`break`,
`continue`, `repeat`, `until`, `exit`) and two new printf features.

- **`break;` / `continue;`** in every loop kind
  (`while`/`for`/`for-each`/`repeat`). Innermost loop only; misuse
  outside a loop or across a method-call boundary is a positioned
  runtime error. `continue` in C-style `for` still runs the step
  before re-checking the condition (matches C/Go).
- **`repeat { } until (cond);`** post-test loop. New keywords
  `repeat` and `until`; `do { } while ...` considered and rejected
  because the inverted condition is the whole point of switching
  to `until`.
- **`exit;` / `exit EXPR;`** terminate the whole program (exit code 0
  / EXPR-as-int). Distinct from `return` (method-scoped): skips every
  caller frame and remaining top-level statement. Implemented as an
  `ExitSignal` sentinel error the CLI translates into the OS exit
  status.
- **Bundled: printf `%s|align=center`** rounds out the align set.
  Rejected on every other typed verb (centred numbers break columnar
  output).
- **Bundled: printf `%a` aggregate verb** for lists and maps
  (deferred from M7; unblocked by M6 + M9). Modifiers: `sep`, `kv`,
  `open`, `close`, `depth=N`, `null=skip`. The modifier-list parser
  was extended with a `"..."` quoted-value form (`%a|sep=", "`) so
  values can contain spaces / reserved characters; standard
  `\n \r \t \\ \"` escapes.
- **Post-dot name relaxation.** Reserved words read as identifiers in
  the name slot of a qualified call (`strings.repeat`,
  `lists.break` if anyone wrote one), preserving the `strings.repeat`
  library function after `repeat` was reserved as a loop keyword.

See:
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  `repeat`/`until`, `break`/`continue` scope rules, `exit` vs
  `return`.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `%a` modifier table,
  `%s|align=center` example, quoted modifier values.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - `%a|json=*` /
  `%a|xml=*` / `%a|yaml=*` (serialisation modifiers stayed rejected
  even after `%a` itself shipped) and the
  `do { } while` shape for the post-test loop.

## M12 - Bytes and bit operators

**Status:** done.

Adds the buffer-shaped primitive and the bit-twiddling vocabulary
the standard library needs for hashing, encoding, crypto, and
network code in later milestones.

- **New primitive type `bytes`** - mutable byte sequence; value
  semantics on assignment / parameter binding; deep-const. Reads
  yield `int` in `[0, 255]`; writes accept the same range and
  reject anything else. Append via the existing M9 `$b[] = byte;`
  sugar. `len($b)` returns the byte count.
- **New `convert.bytesFromString(s, codec)` and
  `convert.stringFromBytes(b, codec)`** - bytes ↔ string codecs.
  Only `"utf-8"` today (further codecs ship in M15.7 `encoding`).
  Invalid UTF-8 input is an error - no silent replacement
  characters.
- **Bit operators on `int`**: `& | ^ ~ << >>`. Python-style
  precedence (comparison < `|` < `^` < `&` < shifts < `+ -`),
  so `$x & 0xff == 0` parses as `($x & 0xff) == 0`. `~` is
  bitwise NOT. Shifts are arithmetic; negative count rejected;
  count >= 64 saturates to 0 / -1. `^` ships as a primitive
  operator (CPU primitive with unique algebraic properties -
  same justification `-` has against being composable from `+`
  and unary `-`).
- **Non-decimal integer literals**: hex `0xff`, octal `0o755`,
  binary `0b1010_0110`. `_` accepted between digits in any base
  (including decimal `1_000_000` and float mantissas). Never
  adjacent to the prefix or another `_`. Lexer-only change.
- **Resolves M7-deferred stdin builtins**:
  `io.readBytes(n) -> bytes` (exact n; partial at EOF then
  `io.eof()` becomes true) and `io.readChars(n) -> string`
  (n runes, UTF-8 decoded). Both compose with M7's `io.eof()`
  unchanged.

See:
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `bytes` type, value semantics, index-write rules.
- [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md) - codec functions,
  UTF-8 strictness.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `io.readBytes`,
  `io.readChars`.
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  bit-operator precedence table.
- [user-guide/syntax.md](user-guide/syntax.md) - non-decimal
  literals + digit separator.

## M13 - Structs and catchable errors

**Status:** done.

The composite-data milestone, batched into two sub-milestones in
dependency order: M13.1 ships the struct mechanism, M13.2 ships
the error-handling design that uses it. Together they unblock
every library that wants composite returns and give the language
a recoverable-error story.

## M13.1 - Structs / records

**Status:** done.

- `def struct Name { field as type, ... };` at top level
  (hoisted before the first statement; duplicate names error in
  `Run`, silently redefine in the REPL).
- Literals `Name{ field: expr, ... }` with every field required;
  `def x as Name;` (no init) zero-fills, recursing through
  nested struct fields.
- Field read `$p.field`, write `$p.field = ...;`. Lvalue chains
  mix `[index]` and `.field` freely (`$L.from.x = 5;`,
  `$bag.items[0] = 99;`); index-assign and field-assign share
  one walker.
- Value semantics like lists/maps; `const` deep at any depth.
- Strict at boundaries: unknown struct type, missing / unknown
  field at literal, field-type mismatch on write, field access
  on a non-struct value are all positioned errors.

  language angle.

## M13.2 - `try` / `catch` / `throw`

**Status:** done.

Catchable errors. New keywords `try`, `catch`, `throw`. Depends
on M13.1 because the canonical error value is a struct.

- `try { body } catch (NAME) { handler }` runs the body and, on
  a catchable error, binds the thrown value to `$NAME` in a
  fresh per-handler scope.
- `throw EXPR;` raises any value; convention is the auto-hoisted
  `Error{kind, message, file, line, col}` struct.
- Runtime errors (out-of-bounds, missing key, type mismatch,
  etc.) are wrapped into the canonical `Error` shape on entry
  to the catch (`kind` defaults to `"runtime"` until sites
  opt in to specific tags); user code catches both kinds
  uniformly. `throw $err;` inside a catch re-raises to the
  enclosing `try`.
- **Not** catchable: `exit` (program-level escape, propagates
  through `try`); `return` / `break` / `continue` (control
  flow, flow through `try` unchanged).
- No `finally` and no typed catch in v1.
- Internals: `ErrorSignal` sentinel parallels `ExitSignal`;
  `runtimeError.Kind` field threads the symbolic tag; user code
  may not redefine the auto-hoisted `Error` struct.

## M14 - Lexer comment + blank-line preservation

**Status:** done.

Closes the two M5-deferred items (`fmt drops comments`, `fmt
drops blank lines`). No language change - the runtime still
never sees comments.

- Lexer emits trivia tokens (`TOKEN_COMMENT_LINE`,
  `TOKEN_COMMENT_BLOCK`, `TOKEN_COMMENT_SHEBANG`,
  `TOKEN_BLANK_LINE`). Shebang on line 1 col 1 is its own kind;
  runs of blank lines collapse to one.
- Preprocessor and parser strip trivia at entry; `jennifer fmt`
  walks the raw lexer stream and re-emits trivia via a dedicated
  `emitTrivia` path that doesn't disturb the surrounding state
  machine.
- Block comments nest via depth counter; unterminated comments
  error at the outermost `/*`.
- Token-level over AST-level: the original spec proposed
  AST-attached `LeadingComments` / `TrailingComment` slots and a
  `jennifer ast --with-comments` flag - dropped in favour of the
  simpler token-level path. Add them back if a future doc
  generator needs structured per-statement attachment.

See:
- [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md#comments) -
  Comments section (block comments nest; inline-comment spacing
  exception).

  emission, shebang detection, nesting depth counter.

**Phase B: foundational libraries (M15.x).** Small,
frequently-used libraries grouped under M15 with sub-numbering.
The leading M15.0 slot is the "wrap-up of existing libraries"
(extensions to M8 / M9 / M10 libraries that depend on language
features added since); later slots ship a new library each.
M15.8 closes the phase by making the result installable before
Phase C starts adding I/O on top.

## M15 - foundational libraries + first public release

**Status:** done. All nine sub-milestones shipped. Three are
language work (M15.2, M15.4), the rest are library / tooling /
release work. Two recurring patterns surfaced in the shipped
APIs and are worth remembering:
- **Codec-table shape** (algorithm/format/codec passed as a
  string argument). Used by `hash.compute(b, algo)`,
  `crc.compute(b, algo)`, `encoding.encode(s, codec)`,
  `encoding.toText(b, format)`. Originally adopted because
  Jennifer's letters-only identifier rule rejects digits in
  method names (so `hash.md5(...)` won't parse), but it also
  honours stance #1 by collapsing parallel verbs into one.
- **Integer-handle struct for opaque resources** (M15.2's
  namespaced-struct mechanism + a single `id as int` field
  indexing into a Go-side map). Used by `os.Process`,
  `hash.Stream`, `crc.Stream`.

### M15.0 - existing-library extensions

**Done.** Two extensions to the M9 `lists` library that needed
post-M14 language features: `lists.shuffle(xs)` (Fisher-Yates,
respects `math.randSeed`) and `lists.range(start, end[, step])`
(half-open, deliberate single-arg omission per stance #2). See
[libraries/lists.md](libraries/lists.md#shuffle) and
[technical/design-decisions.md > Half-open ranges](technical/design-decisions.md#half-open-ranges)
for the half-vs-closed-range rationale.

### M15.1 - `os` + `meta` (process metadata)

**Done.** Reshapes the M8-era `os` surface around one rule:
immutable per-run host facts are uppercase constants
(`PLATFORM`, `ARCH`, `EOL`, `DIRSEP`, `PATHSEP`, `ARGS`),
operations are functions (`getEnv`, `hasFlag`, `flag`). Drops
the `JENNIFER_` prefix that only made sense for bare-global use,
and introduces a new `meta` library for interpreter-self-identity
constants (`VERSION`, `BUILD`). CLI forwards trailing args to
`os.ARGS` (script path at index 0). Breaking renames
(`JENNIFER_VERSION` -> `meta.VERSION`, `os.platform()` ->
`os.PLATFORM`, `os.JENNIFER_OS` -> `os.PLATFORM`,
`os.JENNIFER_LF` -> `os.EOL`); old names now produce plain
"undefined" errors with no rename-hint. See
[libraries/os.md](libraries/os.md) and
[libraries/meta.md](libraries/meta.md).

### M15.2 - Language: library-provided namespaced struct types

**Done.** Language work slotted inside Phase B because the next
wave of libraries (M15.3 `os.{Result,Process}`, M15.5 `time.*`,
M15.6 `hash.Stream`/`crc.Stream`, future M16.1 `fs`, M16.2 `net`)
all need their own struct types and M13.1 only handled bare-IDENT
names. Adds `def x as lib.Name;` type syntax,
`lib.Name{field: ...}` literals, and the Go-side
`Interpreter.RegisterNamespacedStruct` API. Reuses M13.1's value
semantics, deep-`const`, and strict-boundary machinery; only the
resolution path differs. User code can't register structs (Go-side
only); methods on structs and inheritance stay out of scope. See
[technical/interpreter.md > Library-provided namespaced structs](technical/interpreter.md#library-provided-namespaced-structs-m152).

### M15.3 - `os` external-program execution

**Done.** First library to consume the M15.2
namespaced-struct mechanism. Surface: `os.Result {exitCode,
stdout, stderr}` + `os.Process {pid}` as the public types;
`os.run(argv) -> Result` blocking, `os.spawn(argv) -> Process`
non-blocking, `os.wait/poll/kill(p)` for handle ops. `argv` is
always `list of string` (no shell parsing; explicit
`["sh", "-c", $cmd]` for that hop). Non-zero exit codes are
values, not errors. **TinyGo limitation**: TinyGo's runtime
doesn't implement `os/exec`, so the constrained `jennifer-tiny`
binary returns a friendly "use the default `jennifer` binary" error
instead of panicking - first place the two-binary story becomes
user-visible. See
[libraries/os.md > External programs](libraries/os.md#external-programs)
and `examples/exec.j`.

### M15.4 - Language: `len` built-in, `core` removed

**Done.** Promoted `len(EXPR)` from the auto-loaded `core` library
to a reserved keyword + language primary expression (polymorphic
over string / list / map / bytes). Deleted `internal/lib/core/`
entirely; `use core;` now returns a friendly migration error
pointing at the built-in and at `meta.VERSION` / `meta.BUILD`.
Stance #2 ("explicit over implicit") now applies uniformly: every
library name lives behind a `use NAME;` prefix, no exceptions. See
[technical/design-decisions.md > len is a language built-in](technical/design-decisions.md#len-is-a-language-built-in-not-a-library).

### M15.5 - `time`

**Done.** One opt-in library spanning instants, durations,
fixed-offset zones, strftime format/parse, and ISO 8601
round-trip. Three namespaced structs: `time.Time {nanos, offset}`
(fields private API), `time.Duration {nanos}`, and
`time.Zone {offset, name}` (fields public, so an IANA / DST
companion can build them). Granularity (date-only
vs time-of-day-only) is a property of formatting, not the value
type. Unix timestamps are constructor / accessor pairs, not a
separate type. IANA names and DST are out of the fixed-offset
core - a Go-backed `time`-library extension, not a `.j` data map
(see the Long-horizon "`time`: IANA / DST zones" entry). Three
sub-milestones: **M15.5.1** core type + Unix + calendar + 1-based
ISO weekday + arithmetic / comparison; **M15.5.2** strftime
format/parse (chosen over Go's reference-time style for
familiarity; v1 verbs `%Y %m %d %H %M %S %z %a %A %b %B %j %u
%%`) + `time.zone(offset, name)` + `time.inZone` + the `time.UTC`
constant coexisting with the `time.utc()` function via
case-sensitive lookup + `time.iso` / `time.fromIso` RFC 3339
round-trip; **M15.5.3** the `examples/benchmark.j` side-by-side
TinyGo-vs-Go workload suite (eight workloads; the original spec's
"Sieve of Eratosthenes" became trial-division because Jennifer's
value-semantic list mutation turns the sieve into O(N^2)). See
[libraries/time.md](libraries/time.md),
`examples/time{,-format,benchmark}.j`.

### M15.6 - `hash` and `crc`

**Done.** Two opt-in libraries with parallel surfaces: `hash`
for cryptographic-style digests (`"md5"`, `"sha1"`, `"sha256"`),
`crc` for non-cryptographic checksums (`"crc32"` IEEE, `"crc64"`
with Go's `crc64.ECMA` polynomial). Output is raw `bytes`
(big-endian 4 / 8 bytes for CRC, natural width for hash). The
split keeps "transport integrity" vs "content addressing"
visible at the import line and matches Go's `crypto/*` vs
`hash/crc*` arrangement. Both libraries ship the codec-table
shape: `compute(b, algo)` one-shot, `stream(algo)` +
`update($s, $b)` + `finalize($s) -> bytes` for chunked input.
Streaming reuses the
[integer-handle pattern from `os.Process`](#m153---os-external-program-execution).
No convenience wrappers like `hash.md5String` or `hash.computeHex`
(stance #1; users compose `convert.bytesFromString` and
`encoding.toText`). Struct hashing deferred (needs stable byte
serialization, its own design problem). See
[libraries/hash.md](libraries/hash.md),
[libraries/crc.md](libraries/crc.md), `examples/hash.j`.

### M15.7 - `encoding`

**Done.** Three-part surface: introspection
(`isAscii`/`lenBytes`/`lenRunes`), binary-to-text
(`toText`/`fromText` for `"hex"`/`"base64"`/`"base64-url"`), and
character codecs (`encode`/`decode`/`codecs`). The cross-kind
UTF-8 pair stays in `convert` (M12); `encoding` owns the
table-based codec proliferation. Four codecs ship: `"ascii"`,
`"iso-8859-1"`, `"windows-1252"`, `"ebcdic"`. The spec's per-format
verbs (`encoding.hex`, `encoding.base64`, ...) consolidated into
the codec-table pair to dodge the same digit-in-identifier rule
M15.6 hit. Codec names and format strings are exact-match (the one
canonical spelling only; the original alias / case normalisation was
later dropped as a strictness lift, stance #2).
Windows-1252's five canonically-undefined positions (0x81, 0x8D,
0x8F, 0x90, 0x9D) reject symmetrically on encode and decode.
Long-tail single-byte codecs (ISO-8859-{2..16},
Windows-{1250,1251,1253..1258}) later shipped in
[M16.15](#m1615---encoding-completion), generated from the Unicode
mapping files. See
[libraries/encoding.md](libraries/encoding.md),
`examples/encoding.j`.

### M15.8 - distribution + first public release

**Done.** Packaging / CI / release-engineering only; no
`.j`-source language change. Four sub-phases:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`, `release.yml`). PR gate
  runs `go vet` + `gofmt` + `go test ./...` + `make build` +
  per-binary smoke run + repo-wide em-dash scan. Release
  triggers on bare-semver tags (`[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*`, no `v`
  prefix per project convention), cross-compiles both binaries
  for `linux/{amd64,arm64}` from one runner, QEMU-smoke-tests
  the non-native arch, runs the benchmark on amd64 so release
  notes carry fresh numbers, publishes a draft Release.
- **Packaging** under `packaging/{debian,arch,mime,man}/`.
  `scripts/build-deb.sh` produces the `.deb` (binaries +
  gzipped man pages + shared `text/x-jennifer` MIME definition
  + `update-mime-database` hooks). AUR ships `PKGBUILD-bin`
  (release tarball) and `PKGBUILD-git` (source-tracking) with
  a shared `.install` hook. Release pipeline auto-fills
  `PKGBUILD-bin` (real `pkgver` + real `sha256sums_*`) as a
  release asset so the AUR push is a one-step `curl`. The
  `.pacman` standalone artefact from the original spec was
  dropped - `PKGBUILD-bin` + `makepkg` covers the same need.
- **Docs site** via mdBook 0.5.3 (pinned, fetched via direct
  curl from `rust-lang/mdBook` releases - no third-party
  action). `book.toml` at repo root, `src = "docs"`,
  `docs/SUMMARY.md` maps the existing tree into five parts,
  `docs/introduction.md` is the docs-site landing
  (README stays GitHub-repo-focused). `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
  publishes to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- **User-facing install docs**. README gained "Which binary?" +
  "Install" sections with one command per path. `installing.md`
  restructured to put package paths first; build-from-source
  positioned as the developer path. `RELEASE.md` at the repo
  root documents the steps CI can't do (AUR SSH push,
  draft-publish review, pre-tag readiness checks).

**Conventions established (worth keeping)**:

- Bare semver tags (`0.14.1`, no `v` prefix); all pipelines pass
  the tag straight through.
- No top-level `LICENSE` file in v1 - the LGPL-3.0 text ships
  inline in `packaging/debian/copyright` (the form distros
  actually consume) + README links to gnu.org's canonical URL.

**One-time manual setup** before the first push to `main`: in
GitHub repo Settings -> Pages, set "Source" to "GitHub Actions"
so `docs.yml` can deploy.

**Deferred out of this milestone** (not gated on it): the
cross-build for macOS / Windows and a real apt repository stay in
[Requirements for 1.0.0 stable](#requirements-for-100-stable);
the extra distribution formats (Homebrew, Snap, Nix, Flatpak,
AppImage) moved to the [horizon idea collection](horizon.md).

---

## M16 - I/O libraries and developer tooling

**Status:** done. Phase C: system libraries that touch the OS or do
significant compute, opened by a concurrency primitive (M16.0) that the
I/O libraries build on, then a developer-tooling trio (lint / profile /
test) and a run of self-contained data libraries. All sub-milestones
shipped; git history holds the full per-milestone specs.

### M16.0 - Lightweight concurrency

**Done.** `spawn { ... }` (block primary expression), `task of T` (new
compound kind), and the `task` library (`wait` / `poll` / `discard` /
`waitAll` / `waitAny`). Goroutine-backed but data-race-free by
construction: `snapshotForSpawn` deep-copies a two-frame globals+locals
snapshot at launch (tasks are the one carve-out from value semantics -
copies share the `TaskState` pointer). A per-run registry loud-fails
unobserved task errors at exit and bumps the exit code (a non-terminating
undiscarded spawn hangs at exit - the documented trade-off). `task.wait`
re-raises a body error at the wait site for `try`/`catch`; `waitAny` is
the runtime's only `reflect.Select`. The Makefile passes
`-stack-size=2mb -scheduler=tasks` to TinyGo. See
[concurrency.md](user-guide/concurrency.md), [task.md](libraries/task.md).

### M16.1 - `fs`

**Done.** Blocking filesystem I/O composed with `spawn` (no `*Async`
variants): whole-file `read`/`write`/`append` (String/Bytes), metadata
(`exists`/`isFile`/`isDir`/`stat` -> `fs.Stat`), directory ops with the
two-verb recursion split (`mkdir`/`mkdirAll`, `remove`/`removeAll`, plus
`rename`/`list`/`walk`), and buffered `fs.File` handles
(`open`/`readLine`/.../`close`; `eof` peeks one byte). Path- vs
handle-form verbs dispatch on first-arg kind; `fs.File` shares state
across copies (the handle carve-out from value semantics). See
[fs.md](libraries/fs.md).

### M16.2 - `net`

**Done.** TCP (`connect`/`listen`/`accept`/`readBytes`/`writeBytes`),
UDP (`listenUDP`/`sendTo`/`recvFrom`), and DNS
(`lookup`/`reverseLookup`); polymorphic `close`/`address` over three
handle registries. Blocking calls compose with `spawn`
(accept-loop-per-connection). Build-tag split: `jennifer-tiny` returns
friendly-error stubs (no netdev in TinyGo). See [net.md](libraries/net.md).

### M16.3 - `regex`

**Done.** RE2 (Go `regexp`, linear-time) over strings:
`matches`/`find`/`findAll`/`replace`/`split`/`escape`;
`regex.Match{text,start,end,groups,groupsNamed}` with rune indices and a
`start=-1` no-match sentinel; an implicit 128-entry LRU pattern cache.
Full surface in both binaries. See [regex.md](libraries/regex.md).

### M16.4 - `testing` (system-library primitives)

**Done.** The irreducible system-side surface a `.j` test framework needs:
`testing.run(name)` invokes a zero-arg user method via the new
`Interpreter.CallByName`, times it, and classifies every failure mode
into a `testing.Result`; `results`/`reset` manage a mutex-guarded
accumulator; `report` renders text / TAP / JUnit. The one place `exit` is
caught (at the Go level, so language `try`/`catch` still cannot). See
[testing.md](libraries/testing.md).

### M16.5 - Interpreter performance pass

**Done.** Five sub-milestones, user-visible behaviour unchanged: **.1**
shared-marker copy-on-write on compound Values (append-in-a-loop O(N^2)
-> amortised O(N)); **.2** parse-time lexical slot resolution
((Depth,Slot) coordinates + a `slots` slice, undefined/shadowing promoted
to parse-time errors); **.3** pooled + pre-resolved + slot-bound
method-call frames; **.4** namespaced-call / comparison / arg-bind /
root-cache fast paths; **.5** compile-time constant folding plus a
`Share()` scalar fast path. Numbers in [tinygo.md](technical/tinygo.md).

### M16.6 - Developer tooling: linting

**Done.** `jennifer lint` flags compile-legal-but-suspect patterns:
grouped IDs (**L0nn** source errors, always on / **L1nn** correctness /
**L2nn** style / **L3nn** lifecycle), `# lint-disable[-file]: IDS`
suppression, `--checks` / `.jennifer-lint` config, and human / JSON /
GitHub output (source errors render in the chosen format, so a JSON
pipeline stays valid); exit 0/1/2. `!tinygo`. See
[cli_lint.md](technical/cli_lint.md).

### M16.7 - Developer tooling: profiling

**Done.** `jennifer profile` attributes work to `.j` source positions
(what `go tool pprof` cannot): a statement profile (hit count +
self/cumulative wall-clock) and an `--allocs` value-copy profile; table /
pprof (hand-encoded gzipped protobuf) / Chrome-trace output; program
output goes to stderr so the profile owns stdout. `!tinygo`. See
[cli_profile.md](technical/cli_profile.md).

### M16.8 - Testing framework consolidation

**Done.** An assertion vocabulary on M16.4's primitives (`assertEqual`
... `assertThrows`, throwing `Error{kind:"assertion"}` at the call site),
`CallByNameWith`/`runWith` argument dispatch, and the `jennifer test`
subcommand (`test*` discovery or `--filter`, `setUp`/`tearDown`,
`--isolated` per-test subprocess, text/TAP/JUnit, exit 0/1/2). Builtins
can now raise a catchable Jennifer error via `interpreter.RaiseError`. See
[cli_test.md](technical/cli_test.md).

### M16.9 - `json`

**Done.** Hand-rolled RFC 8259 encode/decode onto the tagged-union Value
(no `encoding/json`, no reflect). `encode`/`encodePretty`/`decode`;
structs and `map of string to V` map to objects, `bytes` to base64,
numbers to `int` when integral else `float`. Also closed a type hole: a
generic collection (a fresh literal or decode result) is validated entry
by entry against the declared element type at every binding boundary.
Decode's return shape was later superseded by
[M16.16](#m1616---jsonvalue). See [json.md](libraries/json.md).

### M16.10 - `uuid`

**Done.** RFC 9562: `uuid.generate("v4")` (random) / `generate("v7")`
(time-ordered), the version tag a string argument (identifiers are
letters-only), plus `parse`/`isValid`/`version` and constant `NIL`.
Randomness originally drew from `math`'s seedable RNG; M20.1 repointed it
at `crypto`'s crypto-grade source, so v4 / v7 are now unguessable. See
[uuid.md](libraries/uuid.md).

### M16.11 - `compress`

**Done.** Byte-stream size reduction (distinct from `encoding`'s
representation codecs): `pack`/`unpack` for `"gzip"`/`"zlib"`/`"deflate"`
with an optional `"fast"`/`"default"`/`"best"` level, plus a streaming
`compress.Stream` handle. Go `compress/*`, TinyGo-clean. See
[compress.md](libraries/compress.md).

### M16.12 - `archive`

**Done.** tar / zip containers over `bytes` (no `fs`, value-semantic):
`pack`/`unpack` (verbs shared with `compress`) for
`"tar"`/`"zip"`/`"tar.gz"`; a bundle is a
`list of archive.Entry{name,data,mode,mtime}`. Go
`archive/tar`+`archive/zip`. See [archive.md](libraries/archive.md).

### M16.13 - `os.isTerminal`

**Done.** `os.isTerminal(stream)` (`"stdout"`/`"stderr"`/`"stdin"`) ->
bool, the gate for ANSI colour, via the character-device mode bit
(`os.ModeCharDevice`) - pure stdlib (keeps `x/term` CLI-scoped),
TinyGo-clean; an unstattable stream reports `false`. See
[os.md](libraries/os.md).

### M16.14 - `net` TLS

**Done.** `net.connectTLS(address)` (implicit TLS) and
`net.startTLS(conn)` (in-place STARTTLS upgrade), both yielding the
transport-agnostic `net.Conn`. Certificate verification is on by default,
with a `net.TLSOptions{skipVerify as bool, caCert as bytes}` opt-out. Go
`crypto/tls` on the `!tinygo` build (stubbed on `jennifer-tiny`). See
[net.md](libraries/net.md).

### M16.15 - `encoding` completion

**Done.** Filled out `encoding`: `toText`/`fromText` gained
`quoted-printable`, `base32`/`base32-hex`, `ascii85`, and `z85`; the full
ISO-8859-{1..16} / Windows-{1250..1258} single-byte codecs, generated
from the Unicode mapping files (`gen_codecs.go` -> `codecs_gen.go`) so
only `ascii`/`ebcdic` stay hand-written. Format and codec names are
exact-match (the normalisation layer was dropped as a strictness lift,
stance #2). See [encoding.md](libraries/encoding.md).

### M16.16 - `json.Value`

**Done.** The strict home for heterogeneous JSON without a language top
type: `json.decode` returns an opaque `json.Value` - the first
`KindObject` (the opaque sibling of `KindStruct`: discriminated by
`(namespace, name)`, minted only by a library, rejecting operators /
`[i]` / `.field`). `convert.typeOf` reports `"object"`,
`convert.objectType` the specific `"json.Value"`. Reads and non-mutating
writes share JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) addressing -
`typeOf`/`get`/`has`/`keys`/`length`/`as*`/`isNull` and
`map`/`list`/`set`/`insert`/`append`/`remove`/`move` (strict / no-vivify,
`-` end-marker), with node types in `list`/`map` vocabulary - and a
displayer hook renders a handle as its JSON. `json.decode`'s return type
changed (a pre-1.0 break) and the decoder's number grammar was tightened
to json.org. No `any` keyword (rationale in
[rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)). See [json.md](libraries/json.md).

---

**Phase D: higher-level and Jennifer-coded libraries (M17-M20).**

## M17 - Module system for Jennifer-coded libraries

**Status:** done. All six sub-milestones shipped. Jennifer-coded libraries
now get their own namespace, scope, and explicit `export`s via a real
**module boundary** (`import "x.j" as x;`, parser + interpreter) that lives
beside the textual `include "x.j";` splice (preprocessor, for composing one
module out of several files). The settled, cross-cutting decisions
(turned-down alternatives in [rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)): `import`
is a parser + interpreter feature, not a preprocessor splice; each module is
its own resolution context (own `use` set, namespace + export tables); the
module top level is **declarations-only** - no mutable module state, so
`spawn` capture is unaffected; the one global `Error` stands (modules add
distinctly-named error structs, never redefine it); **private by default**,
a leading `export` publishes a name (no `public` / `private` keyword);
multi-file modules assemble via `include` behind one entry file (no
directory-as-module, no cross-file re-export); modules need a filesystem
(an FS-less `jennifer-tiny` host fails with the ordinary search-path error).
User-facing reference: [imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) +
[modules/index.md](modules/index.md). M18.x builds on top.

### M17.1 - Source tree and resolution

**Done.** Path resolution in `internal/module`: `Classify` + `Resolve` map
an import path (local `./` / `../`, absolute `/`, or a bare name walked on
the search path) to a canonical absolute path, rejecting a name found in
two search dirs and a not-found. The system module directory resolves
`--sysmoddir` > `JENNIFER_SYSMODDIR` > compile-time default (surfaced as
`meta.SYSMODDIR`; a named CLI / env dir that is missing or not a directory
refuses to start, the compile default is best-effort), and `-I DIR`
(repeatable) appends to the search path after it. `jennifer version -v`
reports the resolved layers. See [cli.md](technical/cli.md).

### M17.2 - Import statement and loader

**Done.** `import "path.j" [as NAME];` is a real statement
(`ModuleImportStmt`) - the preprocessor passes it through, the parser
builds the node. The loader (`internal/interpreter/module.go`) runs each
module in a fresh sub-interpreter sharing one `moduleReg` (run-once cache
by canonical path, in-progress load stack, search path), so **run-once**,
**depth-first post-order init**, and **cycle detection** (erroring with
every edge named) all fall out of the recursion. Load-time errors (a parse
error or a throwing `def const` initializer) fail the program and are not
catchable - an `import` is a declaration, not an expression, so it cannot
sit in a `try` / block. `jennifer fmt` / `ast` / `tokens` round-trip an
`import` line. See [imports.md](user-guide/imports.md).

### M17.3 - Module scope and namespacing

**Done.** A module top level is **declarations-only**
(`checkModuleDeclarationsOnly`: only `def const` / `def struct` / `func` /
`use` / `import`; a mutable `def` or free-standing statement is a
positioned load-time error - scripts keep both). `loadModuleImports` binds
each alias (the `as NAME`, or the file stem) into `moduleAliases`,
collision-checked against library prefixes. Consumer resolution rides the
qualified-reference eval layer: `evalQualifiedCall` / `evalQualifiedConst`
dispatch `alias.fn(args)` into the module's own interpreter via
`CallByNameWith` (arguments evaluated in the consumer, body run against the
module's globals + methods) and read `alias.CONST` from its scope. `use`
non-transitivity, run-once sharing, and `-race` safety all follow from the
fresh-sub-interpreter-per-module model - a module holds only immutable
constants and read-only methods. See [interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md).

### M17.4 - Exports and visibility

**Done.** `export` (a keyword) publishes a top-level `func` / `def struct` /
`def const`; unmarked names stay private (reaching `mod.helper` from
outside is a positioned "not exported from module" error), and `export` in
a `jennifer run` script is rejected (module vs script by entry, via the
`isModule` flag). `checkReferentialClosure` rejects an exported struct
field or exported function parameter typed as a *private* module struct;
library / namespaced types cross freely. **Cross-module struct identity**
is boundary translation (`retagStructs`): a module's structs are bare
inside it and re-tagged to `(module-stem, name)` as a value crosses out to
an importer and back on the way in, so `def p as mod.Point`,
`mod.Point{...}`, field reads, and pass-back all type-check while `a.Point`
and `b.Point` stay distinct. The retag walks values *and* the collection
type tags a `list` / `map` carries (`retagType`), so a
`list of mod.Point` handed back into a module reads as its bare
`list of Point` parameter. A co-located `MODULE_test.j` overlay (a token
splice in `jennifer test`) runs white-box tests against the module's
private names.

### M17.5 - `ansi` module

**Done.** `modules/ansi.j` - terminal styling as explicit string wrappers,
the first module built on the system (pure Jennifer, one `use os;`
dependency across the boundary; a real end-to-end dogfood of `import` /
`export` / resolution). Exports `color` / `bgColor` / `style` (bold / dim /
italic / underline / reverse) / `rgb` truecolor / `strip`, plus per-colour
and per-style shortcuts (`ansi.red(s)`, `ansi.bold(s)`, ...). The ESC byte
is built from a one-byte `bytes` (no string-literal escape for it); `strip`
uses `regex`; unknown colour / style names `throw`. Stateless and
TTY-aware: `enabled()` re-reads `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` /
`os.isTerminal("stdout")` per call, so redirected output stays clean and no
toggle state is stored (honours the no-mutable-state rule); degrades to
always-on when `os.isTerminal` is absent. Colour is a string wrapper, so a
`%s|color=` printf modifier is rejected in its favour
([rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)). Demo
`examples/modules/ansi_demo.j`; coverage
`internal/interpreter/module_ansi_test.go` + a white-box
`modules/ansi_test.j` overlay reading ansi's private tables; reference doc
[modules/ansi.md](modules/ansi.md).

### M17.6 - `semver` module

**Done.** `modules/semver.j` - strict [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org) as
a second pure-Jennifer reference module (no system dependency beyond
`use strings; use convert; use regex;`, so it runs on both binaries), and
the foundation the future `jvc` package manager
([Long horizon](#long-horizon-recorded-not-scheduled)) needs since
`install gotify>=1.0.0` is semver comparison at its core. Exports
`Version { major, minor, patch, prerelease, build }` plus `parse` (throws
on invalid) / `isValid` / `toString` (round-trips `parse`); `compare` /
`lt` / `eq` / `gt` (SemVer precedence: numeric core, a prerelease ranks
*below* its release, prerelease fields compared numeric-below-alphanumeric,
build metadata ignored); `isStable` (no prerelease and `major >= 1`;
`0.y.z` is unstable by convention) / `isPrerelease`; `incMajor` / `incMinor`
/ `incPatch` (reset the lower parts, clear pre + build); and `sort` (own
pass over `compare`, since `lists.sort` is scalar-only). Strict, not a loose
parser: a looser N-segment form (`1.2.3.4`) has no defined ordering and is
rejected. `parse` matches the canonical anchored SemVer RE2 pattern with
named groups (`regex.find` + `groupsNamed`); the precedence comparison and
sort are hand-written Jennifer - the algorithmic dogfood. `meta.VERSION` is
valid strict semver, so the module parses Jennifer's own version. Range /
constraint matching (`^1.2.0`, `>=1.0.0`, `~1.2.3`) is the harder parser and
is deferred to (or just before) `jvc`. Building the demo surfaced and fixed
a latent M17.4 boundary gap: passing a consumer-typed `list of semver.Version`
back into a module `list of Version` parameter (`semver.sort`) failed because
the retag re-tagged the struct element *values* but not the list's
element-*type* metadata - now covered by `retagType` (regression
`TestModuleListOfStructCrossesBoundary`). Demo
`examples/modules/semver_demo.j`; white-box `modules/semver_test.j` overlay
(12 tests); reference doc [modules/semver.md](modules/semver.md).

## M18.x - Jennifer-coded modules

Built atop the existing system libraries. Each one ships as a Jennifer
**module** under `modules/` (the directory introduced in M17); none of
them are compiled into the interpreter binary. Sub-milestones in priority
order.

### M18.1-M18.40 - shipped modules (compacted)

**All done.** Forty sub-milestones (with their nested parts) shipped as
pure-Jennifer `modules/` (except where noted as a Go **system library**), each
with the standard discipline: a 100%-passing `*_test.j` overlay, a
`cmd/jennifer/*_test.go` integration test, a `docs/modules/*.md` reference, an
`examples/modules/*_demo.j`, and catalog / README / `JENNIFER.md` entries.
Per-function detail lives in [docs/modules/](modules/index.md); this table is
the milestone-number index (numbers were assigned in rough priority order).

**Enabling changes** these modules pulled into the system side (each documented
under its library):

- **`net.setDeadline`** - a read/write deadline for socket timeouts (M18.13; later
  extended to UDP sockets for `ntp`, M18.27).
- **`io.eprintf`** - the stdout-`printf` twin that writes to stderr (a new
  `Interpreter.Err` / `BuiltinCtx.Err` writer), the stderr sink `log` builds on
  (M18.22).
- **`toml`** and **`httpd`** - two new Go **system libraries** (a char-by-char
  TOML parser and a `net/http` server engine both belong in Go, not a `.j`
  module); M18.8 / M18.9.1.
- **`meta.callMain` / `meta.definedMain`** - resolve a method against the entry
  program (retagging module-own struct args across the boundary), the capability
  the `web` framework dispatches handlers through (M18.9.2).
- **`hash.hmac`** (RFC 2104) and the **`sha512`** digest - the HMAC primitive
  `totp` / `webhook` build on (and that `jwt` / SigV4 will reuse).


## M19 - cross-cutting tooling

The catch-all bucket for milestones that improve the interpreter or its
tooling but belong to neither the Jennifer-coded modules of M18 nor the Go
system libraries of M20. M19.1-M19.5 are a correctness / performance hardening
pass over the interpreter core and libraries (races, dead code, algorithmic
complexity, resource bounds, module identity); M19.6 is the coverage tool;
M19.7 the `@scope/package` vendored-module resolver; M19.8 the one-time
relocation to the `jennifer-language` org and a host-independent vanity module
path; M19.9 the audit-driven correctness + hardening pass. None of this work
needs `reflect` or breaks TinyGo-cleanliness.

### M19.1 - Interpreter concurrency-safety

**Done.** Both interpreter data races fixed, each pinned by a `-race`
stress test (nested-spawn global mutation; eight spawn workers each declaring an
aliased module/library struct in a loop). `snapshotForSpawn` now snapshots the
launching goroutine's own root frame via `effectiveGlobal(env)` instead of the
live `i.global`, so a nested spawn no longer races the main goroutine's global
writes. Declared struct types are stamped once, single-threaded, before any
statement runs (`resolveDeclaredTypesOnce`, after `loadModuleImports`) and carry
a `parser.Type.Resolved` marker, so the per-execution re-resolve in `execDefine`
is a read-only no-op: a `def x as alias.Struct` reached from concurrent
goroutines never re-stamps the shared AST node. Error timing is unchanged (the
stamp pass is best-effort; an unresolved type still errors at execution at its
original position), and the marker also fixes a latent bug where an aliased
library struct re-resolved in a loop hit the "canonical is aliased" rejection.

### M19.2 - Value representation cleanup

**Done.** The inert copy-on-write machinery is gone: `Value.shared`, `Share()`,
`Ensure()`, `ensureCOW`, and the per-`VarExpr`-read `Share()` call are removed;
the four mutation sites now grow the binding's own backing in place, and reads
return the binding value directly. Value semantics rest (as they already did)
on eager deep copies at every store site, documented on the `Value` type and in
`docs/technical/interpreter.md`; the write-through alternative is recorded in
`docs/technical/rejected.md`. The now-dead COW-detachment reporting was stripped
from the `--allocs` profiler (interface, collector, table, pprof) so it no
longer advertises a section that can never fire. A fresh list / map / struct
literal RHS is already private, so `execDefine` / `execAssign` skip the
redundant whole-value copy (`rhsFreshLiteral`) - proven by a profiler-backed
test (literal binding records zero eager copies; an aliasing `def b init $a`
records one) alongside a value-independence test; `value_alias_test.go` and the
full suite (incl. `-race`) stay green. `Value` shrinking stays deferred.

### M19.3 - Runtime performance: maps and the call / loop hot path

**Done.** Maps gained an advisory hash index (`Value.mapIdx`, encoded scalar key
-> position) guarded by a `len(mapIdx) == len(Map)` stamp, so `$m[$k] = $v` over
N keys is O(N) not O(N^2) while insertion order and value semantics are
untouched - any stale / duplicate-key / non-hashable-key case fails the stamp
and falls back to the (correct) linear scan. A 100k-key build plus a 100k
for-each of indexed reads runs in under a second where the quadratic path took
minutes; pinned by `map_index_test.go` (order, updates, misses, duplicate and
non-hashable keys, value-semantics independence, 5k-key consistency). The
call/loop batch landed too: `execForEach` and `execFor` borrow their frames from
`envPool` instead of allocating per iteration / per loop; `DefineAt` skips the
enclosing-scope shadow walk on the resolver-verified slot path; `Run` pre-sizes
`i.global`'s slots from `prog.NumGlobals` (no one-at-a-time O(n^2) growth); the
three mutation sites (`execIndexAssign` / `execAppend` / `execFieldAssign`) fetch
and write the root binding through `(Depth, Slot)` (`getBindingRoot` /
`assignRoot`, guarded to keep the REPL name path chain-walking); and
`lists.reverse` / `head` / `tail` / `slice` / `concat` take a shallow struct copy
instead of deep-copying the whole argument they immediately overwrite. Full suite
(incl. `value_alias_test.go`, the map ordering tests, and `-race`) stays green on
both toolchains.

### M19.4 - Resource lifecycle and numeric strictness

**Done.** `os.spawn` handles are now keyed by a monotonic internal id, not the
OS pid, so a recycled pid can never make a later spawn overwrite an earlier
handle or make `os.wait` / `poll` / `kill` hit the wrong process (pinned by a
distinct-handles test); the reaper also drains the captured buffers into strings
and drops the live `*bytes.Buffer`s so a terminated handle stops pinning them
for the program's life (idempotent `os.wait` and `poll`-after-`wait` are
preserved - literal delete-on-reap would break both, so the persistent-handle
contract stays and an explicit release stays a possible future add). Numeric
strictness: `convert.toInt` and `math.floor` / `ceil` / `round` reject NaN,
+/-Inf, and out-of-int64-range floats with positioned errors instead of an
unchecked `int64(f)` cast, `math.abs(MinInt64)` errors (its magnitude does not
fit), and the `toml` decoder makes an integer past int64 a decode error rather
than a lossy-float downgrade (`json` keeps its deliberate fallback). The
most-negative int literal `-9223372036854775808` (and `-0x8000000000000000`)
now parses to `MinInt64` - folded at the unary-minus site with `ParseUint` +
a 2^63 range check - while the bare magnitude stays a range error. The
uncapped-allocation sinks were already capped ahead of this milestone
(`net`/`fs` `maxReadBytes`/`maxHandleRead`, `compress`/`archive`
`maxDecompressed`). All fixes carry regression tests; full suite green on both
toolchains.

### M19.5 - Module struct identity: keyed by canonical path

**Done.** Module struct values were tagged only by the imported file's **stem**
(`moduleStem`), so two modules whose files share a basename
(`import "a/util.j" as u1; import "b/util.j" as u2;`, or two `@scope/package`
decks) produced values with an identical `(namespace, name)` identity and a
foreign struct passed the other's type check. Struct identity is now keyed by
the module's canonical (resolved) **path**: `Value` and `parser.Type` gained a
`ModPath` field that `Value.Equal` / `MatchesDeclared` compare alongside
`StructNS` (which stays the file stem, for display only, so `%v` still reads
`benchmark.Point`); the boundary retag threads the path, and method parameter
types are stamped by `resolveDeclaredTypesOnce` so a `func f(s as mod.Struct)`
param carries the passed value's identity. Two imports resolving to the same
file stay one type; different files are different types - no import errors, no
collision to reject. Pinned by same-stem-coexist / distinct-stem / re-import
tests; full suite, all 53 overlays, and `-race` green on both toolchains.

### M19.6 - `.j` code coverage

**Done.** `jennifer test --coverage[=text|json]` reports statement coverage by
reusing the profiler's per-position hit data (no second counting path):
`loadForTestProg` installs a statement profiler before running so hits are
captured from top-level init through every test method, and `renderCoverage`
intersects those hits with the executable positions statically walked from the
AST (`statementPositions`, which mirrors `execStmt`'s per-statement recording so
the sets line up). It is scoped to the tested program's files - an imported
module that merely ran does not skew it - and reports per-file plus a total; a
module overlay shows the module and test files separately. `text` (default)
prints percentages and names the never-executed positions; `json` emits a
parseable report that owns stdout (the human test report moves to stderr, the
`profile --format=pprof` rule). The plain `jennifer test` path is unchanged
(`loadForTest` is now a thin wrapper passing a nil collector). Pinned by
render-logic unit tests and end-to-end CLI tests (partial coverage names the
uncovered lines; json parses on stdout; the plain run emits no coverage), and an
HTML view is left as a later `htmlwriter` consumer.

### M19.7 - `@scope/package` module resolution (vendored packages)

**Done.** A leading `@` is a vendored-deck reference, expanded by one function
(`resolveVendor` in `internal/module`): the `@` swaps in the vendor root and a
reference not ending in `.j` gets the package-named entry appended, so
`@claude/bitcoin`, `@claude/bitcoin/`, and an explicit `@claude/bitcoin/utils.j`
all reduce to a plain absolute path - after which resolution, the run-once
cache, and M19.5 path identity are untouched. Because the entry is
`<package>.j` (named after the deck), `moduleStem` gives the package name, so
the display namespace and default alias fall out with zero special-casing
(`import "@claude/bitcoin/"` binds `bitcoin.`); two same-package decks across
scopes (`@a/bitcoin`, `@b/bitcoin`) are distinct types (M19.5) and collide only
on the default alias, resolved with `as`. The vendor root comes from
`module.FindVendorRoot` with the sysmoddir-style layering (`--vendor` flag on
`run`, else `JENNIFER_VENDOR`, else the nearest `vendor/` above the program;
wired into `run` / `repl` / `test` via `SetVendorRoot`). Path safety: `@` only
at the front, no `.`/`..` segments, and the resolved file must stay inside the
deck directory; a missing vendor root is a guided error, not a crash. The parser
exempts `@` deck references from the `.j` requirement. Pinned by module-package
unit tests (expansion, error cases, vendor-root discovery) and end-to-end CLI
tests (entry / explicit-file / default-alias imports, cross-deck type
distinctness, missing-root error); full suite, all 53 overlays, and both
toolchains stay green. The `jvc` manager layered over this stays DRAFT#12.

### M19.8 - Relocation: `jennifer-language` org + vanity module path

A one-time project relocation, no language or interpreter behavior change. The
repository moves from the personal `github.com/mplx/jennifer-lang` to a
`jennifer-language` GitHub org, and - separately - the Go module path moves **off**
GitHub to a vanity import path (`jennifer-lang.dev/jennifer`) served by a
`go-import` meta page, so the module identity no longer depends on where the
code is hosted. Names are settled: the domain `jennifer-lang.dev` is registered,
and the org is `jennifer-language` because `jennifer-lang` and `jenniferlang`
were already taken on GitHub. The domain (`-lang`) and org (`-language`) spelling
differing is deliberate and invisible in use - the canonical module path is the
domain, and the org is only the git host the meta page points at. Purely
mechanical, but it touches nearly every file (112 `.go`
imports, ~60 docs, CI, packaging), so it gets a milestone to keep the sweep
complete and reviewable, and it lands **before the first post-org release** so
downstream references (AUR, doc links) migrate exactly once. Two distinct
targets - keep them separate:

- **Go module path -> the vanity domain.** `go.mod` becomes `module
  jennifer-lang.dev/jennifer`; every internal import
  (`github.com/mplx/jennifer-lang/... -> jennifer-lang.dev/jennifer/...`, 112
  `.go` files) is rewritten. A one-file `go-import` meta page at
  `jennifer-lang.dev/jennifer` maps the vanity path to the org repo
  (`<meta name="go-import" content="jennifer-lang.dev/jennifer git
  https://github.com/jennifer-language/jennifer">`, plus a `go-source` tag for
  pkg.go.dev deep links), served from the same site that hosts the mdBook docs.
  The path is now host-independent: a future repo move never touches `go.mod`
  again.
- **Human-facing URLs -> the org repo.** Clone URLs, issue links, and every
  `github.com/mplx/jennifer-lang/blob/main/...` deep link move to
  `github.com/jennifer-language/jennifer` (flagship repo named `jennifer`, not
  doubled - the `rust-lang/rust` shape). These point at GitHub, **not** the
  vanity domain (the `.dev` host only serves the `go-import` page and the docs).
  GitHub's transfer redirect keeps old links working, but every canonical URL
  in-tree is updated rather than left to the redirect. Sibling repos (`jvc`, the
  deck registry) are created empty under the org as their own milestones land,
  not here.
- **Metadata / CI / packaging sweep.** `README.md` badges and links, `docs/**`
  (installing, tooling, user-guide, technical), `CLAUDE.md`, `JENNIFER.md`,
  `modules/README.md`, `book.toml`, the one example that hardcodes the URL
  (`examples/modules/barcode_demo.j`), the workflows
  (`.github/workflows/{test,docs,release}.yml`), and the packaging manifests
  (`packaging/arch/PKGBUILD-{bin,git}`, `packaging/arch/publish-{bin,git}.sh`,
  `packaging/debian/copyright`, `scripts/build-deb.sh`) all move to the new
  host. `grep -rn 'mplx/jennifer-lang'` comes back empty at the end.
- **Jennifer deck scope.** The first-party package scope in docs / examples
  flips from the placeholder `@mplx/...` to `@jennifer/...` (DRAFT#12 and the
  [M19.7](#m197---scopepackage-module-resolution-vendored-packages) examples),
  matching the org and the registry identity the vanity domain anchors.
  Doc-only until `jvc` and the registry exist.

**Acceptance.** `go get jennifer-lang.dev/jennifer/cmd/jennifer` resolves
through the vanity meta page to the org repo; `go build ./...` and `go test
./...` pass under the new module path; `make build` (both toolchains) still
produces `jennifer` / `jennifer-tiny`; `grep -rn 'mplx/jennifer-lang'` is empty;
the old GitHub URL redirects to the org; the AUR package builds from the new
source; pkg.go.dev serves the module under `jennifer-lang.dev/jennifer`.

### M19.9 - Audit-driven correctness + hardening pass

**Done.** A systematic sweep through the findings of a full
bug-and-performance audit of the interpreter (`internal/`) and the module
library (`modules/`), worked in severity order: criticals first, then the
value-semantics / type-safety holes, then module correctness, performance
(the O(N^2) accumulation patterns), and hardening long-tail. Every fix
lands with a regression test (Go test for interpreter code, `_test.j`
overlay coverage for modules) and both-toolchain builds.

The sweep touched roughly 190 audit findings across the interpreter core and
the module library. Highlights by theme:

- **Crash / safety.** OS-entropy RNG seeding (predictable UUIDs / session ids /
  passwords fixed; `math.randSeed` stays the deterministic opt-in); `json` /
  `toml` decode nesting caps; a catchable-error `try` body that owns its scope
  so a throw-skipped `def` reads as undefined, not null; recursion guards
  (`tengine`); zip-slip and aggregate-decompression caps (`archive`); a
  JSON-pointer index overflow guard; the two interpreter `-race` data races
  (nested-spawn snapshot, runtime AST re-stamp) and REPL-vs-spawn table mutation.
- **Correctness.** Lvalue writes re-fetch their root after evaluating the RHS;
  index / append stores stamp the container's element type; module structs are
  path-identity keyed; the Code 128 stop pattern, EAN check digit, Code 39 `*`,
  and QR mask rule 3 in `barcode`; `pdfwriter` WinAnsi / Info encoding; a full
  `toml` conformance pass (datetime / string / number grammar, `\u` surrogates,
  the four table-redefinition MUST-errors); `http.j` header / chunked-body
  hardening, `web` CSRF / cookie / CORS / ETag, quote-aware `vcard` / `ical`
  parsing, and many module `Error`-kind / status-guard fixes.
- **Performance.** The O(N^2) accumulation patterns retired across the board:
  the map hash index, `json` object decode, wire-framing reads
  (`redis` / `amqp` / `mqtt` / `mikrotik` / `imap` / `websocket`), and list-join
  output builders (`csv` / `barcode` SVG / `influxdb` / `jsonl` / `statsd`);
  plus the GF(256) inline in `barcode`, `KindObject` payload sharing, the
  slot-authoritative write path, pooled loop frames, and index-aware `maps`.
- **Lifecycle / diagnostics.** `os.release` and capped child output; `net.eof`
  non-blocking + mutex-guarded `net.Conn`; `httpd` admission bounds, must-respond
  timeout, TLS-1.2 floor, and safe unix-socket unlink; per-stream mutex + a
  `discard` verb on hash / crc / compress streams; `lint` descending into
  `spawn` / `repeat` and honouring included-file suppression; per-goroutine
  profiler trace tracks.

**Break notes - six coordinated pre-1.0 strictness rulings** (each shipped with
tests and the operator / scoping docs updated):

- **`%` is now floored** (Python semantics), consistent with `//`, so the
  div/mod identity holds for negative operands: `-7 % 3 == 2`, `7 % -3 == -2`
  (was C/Go truncation `-1` / `1`). Runtime and constant folding changed
  together.
- **Integer arithmetic overflow is a positioned error**, not a silent wrap:
  `9223372036854775807 + 1` (and `-`, `*`, `MinInt64 // -1`) errors; overflowing
  literal ops are left unfolded so the runtime raises at the right position.
- **A duplicate key in a map literal is an error** (`{"a":1,"a":2}`), not a
  corrupt two-entry map where only the first was reachable.
- **Mixed `int`/`float` comparison is exact** (including `==`): the int is not
  promoted to a lossy `float64`, so `9007199254740993 == 9007199254740992.0` is
  `false` and orderings are correct above 2^53.
- **A method may not share its name with a top-level variable or constant**
  (`def foo ...; func foo() {}` is a parse error) - no-shadowing now applies both
  directions across the def/func namespace.
- **Reading a constant with the `$` sigil is a parse error** (`$MAX`); the sigil
  is reserved for mutable variables (`$CONST[...]` still reports the clearer
  "cannot mutate constant" error).

## M20 - system libraries

Go **system libraries**: cryptographic primitives, plus formats too heavy
or too reflect-bound for a Jennifer-coded `.j` module (the `json` pattern,
[M16.9](#m169---json)). Members below; more land as M20.x as needs arise.

### M20.1 - `crypto`

**Done.** The security-primitives system library above the digests in `hash`,
Go stdlib only (`crypto/rand` / `subtle` / `hkdf` / `pbkdf2`, so no dependency;
both binaries, TinyGo 0.41 carrying the Go 1.24 KDF packages). Crypto-grade
random `crypto.randBytes(n)` / `randInt(lo, hi)` (inclusive, rejection-sampled
so exactly uniform, unseedable - the counterpart to `math`'s fast, predictable
`rand*`, for values that guard something); constant-time `crypto.hmacEqual(a,
b)` (Go `crypto/subtle`; HMAC itself stays `hash.hmac`); key derivation
`crypto.hkdf(secret, salt, info, length, algo)` (HKDF, RFC 5869) and
`crypto.pbkdf(password, salt, iterations, keyLen, algo)` (PBKDF2, RFC 8018),
`algo` one of `"sha1"` / `"sha256"` / `"sha512"` (SCRAM-SHA-1 needs `"sha1"`;
registered `pbkdf` not `pbkdf2` for the letters-only name rule). `uuid`'s random
source was repointed here (one function, no surface change), so
`uuid.generate("v4")` is unguessable - securing the `session` module,
`web.sessionId` / `csrfToken`, and the `password` module's generation for free.
Password *hashing* (Argon2id / bcrypt / scrypt) stays out (needs `x/crypto`);
PBKDF2 here is for interoperable KDF needs (SASL SCRAM, key wrapping), not a
general password store.

### M20.2 - `xml`

**Done.** Hand-rolled XML encode / decode (no `encoding/xml`, reflect-heavy and
TinyGo-hostile - the reason `json` / `toml` are hand-rolled too), over an opaque
`xml.Value` (`KindObject`) mirroring the `json.Value` read / write vocabulary
([M16.16](#m1616---jsonvalue)) but over an element tree (a tag name + ordered
attributes + ordered, possibly-duplicated element/text children, each node an
ordered `map` so mixed content and whitespace round-trip) with an XPath-style
path dialect (`/`-separated `name` / `name[k]` 1-based / `*`) in place of JSON
Pointer. `xml.decode(s)` parses elements, attributes, text, CDATA (as text), the
five predefined entities + numeric references (unknown = error), and skips
comments / PIs / the XML declaration / a DOCTYPE; namespace prefixes kept
verbatim (`ns:tag`, `xmlns` an ordinary attribute), errors carry line / column.
Read: `typeOf` / `tag` / `text` / `attr` / `hasAttr` / `attrs` / `children` plus
path-addressed `get` / `findAll` / `has`. Encode: `xml.encode` / `encodePretty`
(pretty indents element-only content, inlines any element with a text child so
character data stays byte-exact); non-mutating build surface `element` /
`setAttr` / `setText` / `append`, each a fresh handle. Deferred: full namespace
resolution (prefixes stay lexical) and richer XPath (predicates, `@attr` /
`text()` steps).

### M20.3 - `yaml`

**Done.** Full YAML 1.2 encode / decode over an opaque `yaml.Value`
(`KindObject`), mirroring [`toml`](#m188---toml-system-library) /
[`json`](#m1616---jsonvalue) exactly: the same read accessors (`typeOf` / `get`
/ `has` / `keys` / `length` / `as*` / `isNull`, JSON-Pointer-addressed) and
non-mutating write surface (`map` / `list` / `set` / `insert` / `append` /
`remove` / `move`), plus `asDatetime` / `isDatetime` for the timestamp scalar.
`yaml.decode(s)` handles one document (a multi-doc stream errors, pointing at
`yaml.decodeAll(s) -> list of yaml.Value`; empty is `null`); scalars type by
YAML implicit resolution, `!!binary` becomes `bytes`, a non-scalar mapping key
is rejected, anchors / aliases resolve **by value** (independent copies), and
`<<` **merge keys** apply (own key wins, earlier source wins). `yaml.encode` is
flow style (compact, `{a: 1, b: [x, y]}`) and `encodePretty` block style -
YAML's analogue of json's compact / pretty pair; `bytes` encodes as `!!binary`,
a `time.Time` as a timestamp (block preserves the type on round-trip, flow
quotes it). Unlike the hand-rolled `json` / `toml` / `xml`, the parse is
delegated to `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` - the one place a config parser earns a Go
dependency (full YAML, with anchors / flow+block / implicit typing / streams, is
a project of its own), verified TinyGo-clean (builds *and* runs on both binaries
under TinyGo 0.41 / Go 1.26; the project's first non-CLI-scoped dependency).
Because yaml.v3 is recursive-descent (deeply-nested input recurses per level and
overflows jennifer-tiny's fixed 2 MiB stack fatally at ~350 levels, under
yaml.v3's own 10000 cap), a raw-text depth pre-scan rejects nesting past 128
levels *before* the parse, and a five-million-node budget caps an alias bomb -
both catchable errors, not a stack or memory kill. Deferred: multi-document
encode (`encodeAll`) and per-node style control.

### M20.4 - `intl`

**Done.** Message catalogs and locale-aware translation, named **`intl`**
(letters only, matching JS `Intl`) not `i18n` per the letters-only rule that
forced `iic` / `pbkdf`. A **system library** not a `.j` module for two reasons:
it holds global mutable state (current locale + loaded catalogs) a declarations-
only module cannot, and it keeps each catalog in a Go `map[string]string` for
O(1) lookup where Jennifer's linear-scan `map` would be O(n) per call; the state
is per-interpreter (closed over in `Install`) and RWMutex-guarded for `spawn`
safety. Surface: `intl.load(lang, catalog)` (a `map of string to string`, a
literal or decoded from `json` / `toml` / `yaml`; re-loading a language merges,
and the first language loaded is the default), `intl.setLocale` / `intl.locale`,
and `intl.tr(key[, params])` translating through a fallback chain (current locale
-> its base language `de-AT` -> `de` -> the default language -> the key itself,
so a gap stays visible) with `{name}` interpolation (`{{`/`}}` escape, non-string
params stringified, unknown placeholders left literal). Interpolation is
single-pass (a substituted value is never re-scanned - no recursive blow-up) and
its output is capped at 1 MiB, checked incrementally, so an amplification bomb
from an untrusted catalog errors before the oversized string is built rather than
toward OOM. No gettext `_()` (not a valid method name, and an ambient global is
exactly what stances 2 / 7 rule out); `printf`-for-translation is rejected (see
[rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)) - translation is content substitution, not
presentation. Follow-ons: pluralization, `loadFile`, catalog reset / replace
(`load` is merge-only), and locale-aware *value* formatting.

### M20.5 - `term`

**Done.** A `term` system library exposing the terminal host capabilities a TUI
needs and pure `.j` cannot reach: **raw mode** (`term.makeRaw("stdin")` ->
`term.State` / `term.restore(state)` - unbuffered, no-echo input; raw mode is
stdin-only, and the handle is single-use so a stale restore can't clobber a live
terminal, its backing registry capped so an unbalanced `makeRaw` without a
matching `restore` errors rather than leaking unbounded), **terminal size**
(`term.size(stream)` -> `term.Size{rows, cols}`), and **raw single-byte reads**
(`term.readByte()` -> int, `0`-`255` or `-1` at EOF - bytes, not decoded keys;
escape-sequence decoding is the TUI layer's job). Over `golang.org/x/term` (the
REPL line editor's dependency, now also a build-tag-gated *library* dependency);
raw mode / size operate on the real terminal device by fd (like `os.isTerminal`),
`readByte` reads the interpreter's input reader (so it composes with raw stdin and
stays testable), and raw-mode verbs / `readByte` are refused in the REPL (it owns
the terminal). Build-tag split like `net`: real over `x/term` on the default
`jennifer`, a friendly-error stub on `jennifer-tiny` (a minimal target may have no
TTY, and the tiny build excludes `x/term`). The enabler for interactive TUIs (the
pure-ANSI screen control / key decoding / rendering sit in the
[M21.1](#m211---screen--tui-module) `screen` / `tui` module on top); output-only
TUIs need only `ansi` + `os.isTerminal`. `examples/term.j` is a guarded
interactive demo needing a real TTY, so it is not a golden test.

### M20.6 - signals (diagnostics + `os` polling API)

**Done.** Unix-signal support in cooperative pieces (a delivered signal only sets
an atomic flag; nothing runs `.j` in a signal context, so the single-threaded /
value-semantics model holds):

- **`SIGUSR1` -> live interpreter diagnostics.** `kill -USR1 <pid>` makes the
  interpreter print a one-shot snapshot to stderr - a fixed labeled block:
  timestamp, current `.j` `file:line:col`, spawned / live task counts, goroutine
  count, and heap / sys memory + GC count - and keep running (dump-and-continue,
  unlike Go's dump-and-die `SIGQUIT`). A method-name call stack and loop depth
  are a planned addition (they need call-frame tracking). The handler only sets
  `Interpreter.diagReq` (atomic); the snapshot prints on the interpreter
  goroutine at its next loop-iteration / method-call checkpoint
  (`if i.diagReq.Load()` - a plain memory load, free on the hot path), so it is
  race-free. This answers "stuck in a loop, *where*?". Wired by the CLI
  (`cmd/jennifer/diag_unix.go`, built on `unix` so both binaries get it), so
  `os.catchSignal("usr1")` is reserved (a positioned error pointing at `usr2`).
  The block is labeled (time, position, spawned / live tasks, goroutines,
  heap / sys memory + GCs). A richer snapshot (method-name call stack, loop
  depth) is a later refinement.
- **Script-facing signals -> `os.catchSignal(name)` / `os.gotSignal(name)`.** Opt
  into trapping (`"int"` / `"term"` / `"hup"` / `"usr2"`), then poll-and-clear
  whether it arrived. The flagship is graceful shutdown - a server / TUI catching
  `SIGTERM` to close connections, `term.restore`, and clean up before exiting.
  Trapping is **opt-in per signal**, so `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` keep their default
  terminate disposition until the program catches them (a normal script is still
  stopped by Ctrl-C). Process-global state (signals are a process property),
  build-tag split (`signal_unix.go` real on `unix` / `signal_other.go` stub on
  `!unix`) so Windows errors cleanly rather than fail to compile the Unix-only
  `SIGUSR1` / `SIGUSR2` / `SIGHUP`. TinyGo has full `os/signal`, so both binaries
  handle signals on a Unix host - `jennifer-tiny`'s cooperative scheduler only
  defers *observation* to a yield point (a pure CPU-bound loop may not see a
  signal until it blocks / sleeps; the OS-level trap still suppresses the default
  terminate). The default `jennifer` (preemptive) has no such latency.
- **Terminal restore on abort.** `term.RestoreAll()` (over the M20.5 registry)
  plus `defer termlib.RestoreAll()` in the CLI run path put the terminal back if a
  `.j` script raw-modes stdin and then aborts (an uncaught error, `exit`, a panic
  unwind) - Jennifer has no `finally`, but the CLI has Go's defer. Fixes a real
  M20.5 gap where a raw-moded script that errored left the shell wedged.

Deferred to the **cooperative loop-cancellation** follow-on, for which this
milestone establishes the checkpoint hook: an interruptible runaway loop, a REPL
Ctrl-C that unwinds to the prompt, the double-Ctrl-C force-abort, the
REPL-reserved-`SIGINT` rule, and a terminating-signal handler that restores the
terminal on a bare `SIGTERM` / untrapped `SIGINT` (whose default action skips the
`defer`). `os.kill` gaining a signal-name argument is also open; `SIGKILL` stays
unrecoverable (uncatchable, as for any program).

### M20.7 - `defer` (deterministic cleanup)

**Done.** A `defer CALL(args);` statement that schedules a single call to run when
its enclosing block exits, on **every** exit path. The motivating problem is resource
cleanup for the handle libraries - `fs.close` / `fs.sync`, `term.restore`,
`net.close`, `os.Process` release, the M20.9 `sql` client's connections - which
today needs a verbose `try { ... } catch (e) { close(); throw $e; }` plus a
second close on the success path, and silently breaks the moment someone adds an
early `return`. `defer` collapses that to one line placed right next to the
acquisition.

Semantics:

- **Single call, not a block.** `defer fs.close($f);` takes a call expression,
  never a `{ ... }` body. This is what sidesteps Java `finally`'s notorious
  footgun (a `return` / `throw` inside `finally` swallowing the try's exception
  or overriding its return): the hazard is simply unrepresentable.
- **Arguments evaluated now, call runs later.** `defer fs.close($f);` captures
  `$f`'s current value at the `defer` line and runs the call at scope exit. With
  value semantics and handle-into-registry resources, capturing the handle value
  is exactly right, and it needs **no closures** (which Jennifer deliberately
  lacks) - the defer model falls out of value semantics rather than fighting them.
- **Block-scoped, LIFO.** Deferred calls run at the end of the enclosing `{}`
  block, last-registered first. Block scope (not Go's function scope) means a
  `defer` inside a loop body runs at the end of each iteration - fixing Go's
  best-known `defer`-in-a-loop pile-up. A top-level `defer` runs at program end.
- **Runs on every exit:** fall-through, `return`, `break`, `continue`, a `throw`
  unwind, and `exit`. That universality is the whole point.
- **Does not cross the method or `spawn` boundary** (same rule as `break` /
  `return` / `continue`): a method's defers run at that method's scope exit, not
  the caller's.
- A `throw` from within a deferred call propagates; if the block was already
  unwinding an error, the deferred call's error supersedes (documented, like
  Go's panic-in-defer).

The pairing with `fs.sync` matters for durability: `defer` the `close` (cleanup
you do not inspect), but call `fs.sync` explicitly and check it - a durability
failure must surface *before* the program tells the user "safe to remove", not as
a deferred call running too late on the way out.

Not `finally`: rejected as redundant with `defer` + `try` / `catch`, carrying
Java's return/throw-in-finally footguns, and violating one-obvious-way. Student
familiarity is its only advantage and does not outweigh a cleaner, safer
construct that also fits the value-semantics / no-closures model. A
`rejected.md` entry records the decision.

Implementation: a new `defer` keyword; `execBlock` tracks a per-block list of
pending calls (only blocks that register a defer allocate one) and runs them LIFO
before returning or propagating any control-flow / error signal. No `reflect`,
TinyGo-clean. The CLI already models the idea at the Go level
(`defer termlib.RestoreAll()`); this brings it into the language.

### M20.8 - device I/O (`serial` / `spi` / `iic` / `gpio`)

Device-I/O libraries for embedded / single-board-computer hosts, all reaching
the Linux `/dev` + `ioctl` interface that `.j` and plain `fs` cannot: `serial` /
`spi` / `iic` are the three buses, and `gpio` here is the character-device
(`/dev/gpiochipN`) form of the sysfs-backed `gpio` **module**
([M18.11](#m1811---gpio-module)). Each needs `ioctl` / `termios`, so they are Go
**system libraries**, not modules:

- **`serial`** - open a serial port (`/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyAMA0`), configure
  it (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits via `termios`), then `read` /
  `write` / `close`. Setting the baud rate is a `termios` `ioctl`, unreachable
  from `fs` - which is what forces a library.
- **`spi`** - open a SPI device (`/dev/spidev0.0`), set mode / speed, and
  `transfer(bytes) -> bytes` (full-duplex), via the `SPI_IOC_MESSAGE` `ioctl`.
- **`iic`** - the I2C bus (`/dev/i2c-1`): select a slave address and `read` /
  `write` register bytes via the `I2C_SLAVE` `ioctl`. Named **`iic`** (Inter-IC)
  rather than `i2c` because a library namespace is letters-only (no digit, like
  `bucket` not `s3`); candidates `iic` / `twi` / `wire`, settled at build time.
- **`gpio`** - the `/dev/gpiochipN` character-device interface (the
  `GPIO_V2_LINE_*` ioctls: request lines with a direction, then read / write /
  watch), the mainline-supported GPIO API since `/sys/class/gpio` was deprecated
  and compiled out of some kernels. This is precisely the "swapped for a
  `/dev/gpiochip` ioctl system library, no change to `.j` scripts" successor the
  [M18.11](#m1811---gpio-module) module's own docs already name - so it lands
  here **only when forced** (a target that ships without sysfs GPIO), *not* as a
  replacement: the sysfs `.j` module stays the default (it costs the language
  nothing and runs on the hobbyist Pi kernels it targets), and the library
  reuses the module's pin-keyed shape (`setup` / `read` / `write` / `release`)
  so scripts move over unchanged. The one open call is whether the two then
  unify behind a single selectable-backend surface (stance 1) or stay a
  module / library pair chosen by deployment.

Build-tag split like `net` / `os`: the real implementation on Linux (the
supported platform), a friendly-error stub elsewhere. Default binary; a
`jennifer-tiny` rebuilt for a specific board could include them (TinyGo's
`machine` package is a different, microcontroller-level API - these target the
Linux `/dev` + `ioctl` interface). Together they complete the SBC I/O story.

### M20.9 - `sql` (MySQL / MariaDB + PostgreSQL)

A relational-database client library over Go's `database/sql`, shipping the
two **client-server** engines: MySQL / MariaDB (`go-sql-driver/mysql`) and
PostgreSQL (`jackc/pgx`), both **pure-Go** drivers (no cgo, so cross-compile
and the best-effort macOS / Windows artifacts stay clean). SQLite - the one
*embedded* engine - is deliberately **not** here; it needs a multi-MB
dependency and cannot build under TinyGo, so it stays a build-tag opt-in
parked in [horizon](horizon.md) (the `jennifer-full` variant).

**Why a Go library and not a `.j` module over `net`.** MySQL and Postgres are
open TCP wire protocols, so a client *is* writable in pure Jennifer - the same
shape as `redis` / `memcache` / `imap`, and the auth crypto it needs (SHA-1,
SHA-256, `hash.hmac`, PBKDF2 as iterated HMAC) already ships. The deciding
factor is not performance: a database client is **latency-bound** (network
round-trip + server execution dominate; client-side decode only becomes the
cost center when streaming 10^5+ rows, a bulk workload Jennifer is not the
right tool for regardless of driver), and the COW shared-marker protocol
already makes materializing a large result set amortized O(N). The deciding
factor is **correctness maturity**: the mature drivers have absorbed a decade
of protocol long-tail - every auth plugin (MySQL `caching_sha2_password`
full-auth / the RSA path, Postgres SCRAM-SHA-256), charset handling, NULL
semantics, multi-result-sets, server-version quirks - that a hand-rolled `.j`
client would re-derive one edge case at a time. For databases users depend on
daily, that maturity is worth the dependency. Going Go also makes the auth
crypto the driver's problem, not the language's, so this needs nothing from
[M20.1 `crypto`](#m201---crypto).

**The deliberate dependency break.** These are the **first heavyweight
dependencies in the library layer** - a conscious exception to the
dependency-free discipline `CLAUDE.md` states for the library layer. The
precedent is [M20.3 `yaml`](#m203---yaml), which took a single pure-Go
dependency (`gopkg.in/yaml.v3`) for a parser too big to hand-roll; alongside
CLI-scoped `golang.org/x/term`, those are the only third-party dependencies
today. The sql drivers go further - both are pure-Go, but they are real
dependency trees. The exception gets a
reasoning record in [technical/design-decisions.md](technical/design-decisions.md)
when it lands - the sanctioned home for a feature that ships despite appearing
to cut against project doctrine - justified as above, not slid into.

**Build / TinyGo.** Build-tag split exactly like `net` / `httpd`:
`sqllib_std.go` (`//go:build !tinygo`) imports `database/sql` + drivers;
`sqllib_tiny.go` (`//go:build tinygo`) registers `use sql;` and returns a
friendly positioned "not available on this build" error. TinyGo never
compiles the driver imports, so the language stays TinyGo-clean and the
interpreter core is untouched. On stock `jennifer-tiny` the engines are
unavailable anyway (no net driver), consistent with every net-backed module.

**Surface.** Integer-handle-into-a-registry like `fs` / `net`:
`sql.open(driver, dsn) -> Connection`, `sql.query(conn, sql, params...) ->
Rows`, `sql.exec(conn, sql, params...) -> Result` (affected-rows /
last-insert-id), prepared statements, `sql.begin` / `commit` / `rollback`
transactions, `sql.close`. **Values bind only through placeholders**
(injection safety) - `database/sql` abstracts the per-driver spelling (`?`
for MySQL, `$1` for Postgres). The result-row shape is an opaque `sql.Row`
`KindObject` mirroring `json.Value` (foreshadowed in interpreter note 18),
walked by accessors; a typed-struct path waits on the deferred map-to-struct
conversion. A `.j` `postgres.j` module (Postgres has the clean protocol, no
RSA gap) remains a possible later *optional* dependency-free alternative and
language stress-test - not the primary path.

**Builds on.** The [M21.5 `orm` module](#m215---orm-module) is layered on this
library (its hard prerequisite) and inherits the `sql.Row` caveat above - its
typed-row ergonomics wait on the same deferred map-to-struct conversion, so it
graduates in stages.

## M21 - general backlog (catch-all)

The general holding area for milestones that fit no other bucket - not a
Jennifer-coded module (M18), not interpreter / tooling work (M19), not a Go
system library (M20), and not a beyond-1.0.0 idea (embedding, WASM, and the
rest live in the [horizon collection](horizon.md)). It is the top-level
counterpart to M19's tooling bucket:
anything worth recording that has no natural home lands here as a numbered
sub-entry, and graduates out into its own bucket once a cluster grows enough to
deserve one.

### M21.1 - `screen` / `tui` module

Jennifer's terminal-UI answer - a `.j` module for terminal user interfaces,
since there is no GUI medium-term, so the terminal is the interactive surface.
Layered so the output-only subset ships with no host dependency:

- **Stage 1 (no prerequisite).** Pure-ANSI screen control over `ansi`: cursor
  movement, clear, alternate-screen buffer, hide / show cursor, box-drawing,
  and a screen buffer + render / diff loop. Enables **output-only TUIs** - live
  dashboards, progress bars, spinners, self-updating tables (the `rich`-style
  subset). Pure strings; TinyGo-clean.
- **Stage 2 (needs [M20.5](#m205---term)).** A key-event decoder (parse the raw
  byte stream - `ESC [ A` -> Up, and so on) plus an event loop over `term`'s
  raw mode / size / key reads. Enables **interactive TUIs** - menus, forms, key
  navigation (the `curses` / `bubbletea` subset).

Positioned as an *explicit* terminal UI, not a GUI framework. Named `screen`
or `tui` (settled at build time). Parked in the general backlog for now; it can
graduate into the M18 module track when built.

### M21.2 - `feed` module (RSS + Atom)

A `feed` module for web syndication feeds: **build and parse** both RSS 2.0
and Atom 1.0. **One** module, format selected on build and detected on parse
(design stance 1 - not separate `rss` / `atom` modules); a feed is a value-
semantic `Feed` (title, link, updated, entries) of `Entry` (title, link, id,
published / updated, summary, content). It composes across the stack: `http`
fetches a feed, `feed` parses it, `time` handles the RFC 3339 / RFC 822 dates -
a feed reader, podcast client, news aggregator, or changelog-to-feed generator
in a few lines.

Parked here because it is **gated on [M20.2 `xml`](#m202---xml)**: RSS / Atom
parsing needs a real XML parser (entities, CDATA, and Atom's XML namespaces),
which is exactly why `xml` is a system library rather than a hand-rolled `.j`
scanner - so feed *parsing* rides it. Feed *building* (emitting escaped XML)
could predate `xml`, but build and parse ship together on the same layer. Also
uses `http` (fetch) and `time` (dates); pure `.j` otherwise. It graduates into
the M18 module track once `xml` lands. Discipline as usual: a
`modules/feed_test.j` overlay (build / parse round-trips and date handling for
both formats as pure helpers; a networked fetch-and-parse against an in-process
server in a Go test), `docs/modules/feed.md`, a catalog row, a `SUMMARY.md`
entry, a `modules/README.md` entry, a `JENNIFER.md` bullet, and a runnable
`examples/modules/feed_demo.j`.

### M21.3 - `jwt` module (JSON Web Tokens)

A JWT (RFC 7519) module. The HMAC algorithms (HS256 / HS384 / HS512) need only
the shipped `hash.hmac` and could stand alone, but the module targets the full
common surface - including the asymmetric **RS256 / ES256** that OAuth / OIDC
rely on - so it is parked here **gated on [M20.1 `crypto`](#m201---crypto)** for
the public-key signing / verification, and graduates into the M18 module track
when `crypto` lands. Surface: `jwt.sign(claims, key, alg)`, `jwt.verify(token,
key) -> claims` (checks the signature and the `exp` / `nbf` time claims), and
`jwt.decode(token) -> claims` (read without verifying). Over `hash.hmac` (+
`crypto` for RS / ES), `encoding` (base64url), `json`, and `time`. **`jwt_auth`**
is not a separate module: it is this module used as a `web.before` middleware
that pulls the bearer token from the `Authorization` header, `jwt.verify`s it,
and rejects on failure (`func requireJwt(ctx) { ...; return true; }`) - shipped
as a snippet in the demo / docs, not its own surface. Discipline as usual: a
`modules/jwt_test.j` overlay (sign / verify round-trips and tampered-token
rejection), docs, catalog, and demo.

### M21.4 - `acme` module (Let's Encrypt / ACME)

An ACME (RFC 8555) client - obtain and renew TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt
and compatible CAs: account registration, an order plus HTTP-01 / DNS-01
challenge, CSR submission, and certificate download, over `http` + `json`. Parked
here **gated on [M20.1 `crypto`](#m201---crypto)**: ACME requests are JWS-signed
with an account key (RS256 / ES256) and the flow needs CSR generation - both
asymmetric-crypto operations. Composes with `web` / `httpd` to serve the HTTP-01
challenge. Graduates into the M18 module track when `crypto` lands. Needs the
default binary. Discipline as usual.

### M21.5 - `orm` module

A relational mapper layered over the [M20.9 `sql`](#m209---sql-mysql--mariadb--postgresql)
library (its **hard prerequisite** - no `sql`, no `orm`), and a good stress-test
of how far the module system stretches. Jennifer's semantics dictate the shape,
and it is **Data Mapper, not Active Record**: structs are value-semantic and
carry no methods, and a module is declarations-only with no mutable state, so a
row object cannot know how to `save()` / `delete()` itself and there is no place
to hold identity-map or dirty-tracking state. The pattern is therefore a
**repository / table-gateway** - the caller passes a record and a schema to
module functions: `orm.insert(conn, schema, record)`, `orm.find(conn, schema,
id) -> record`, `orm.update` / `orm.delete`, `orm.all(conn, query)`.

Three constraints shape the surface:

- **Explicit schema descriptor (no reflection).** `.j` cannot introspect a
  struct's fields, so the caller declares the mapping once - an `orm.Schema`
  (table name, column-to-field list, primary key, per-column type) built with a
  small constructor. This is the module's central object; everything keys off it.
- **Non-mutating functional query builder**, mirroring the `json.Value` write
  surface (`set` / `insert` / `append` returning fresh handles) rather than
  method chaining (values have no methods): `orm.where(orm.from(schema), "age",
  ">", 18)` returns a new `orm.Query`, composed functionally through
  `orm.where` / `orm.orderBy` / `orm.limit` / `orm.join`, then rendered to
  **parameterized** SQL - values bind only through placeholders (injection
  safety inherited from `sql`). A small **dialect** layer (placeholder spelling
  `?` vs `$1`, identifier quoting, `LIMIT` / `OFFSET`, `RETURNING`) is a backend
  selector on one module, not parallel modules (stance 1 / the one-module rule).
- **Row-to-struct mapping is partly gated.** `sql.query` yields an opaque
  `sql.Row`; turning it into a *typed* struct wants the deferred **explicit
  map-to-struct conversion** ([horizon](horizon.md)). So `orm` ships in two
  steps: first a `map of string to V` (or by-hand field extraction via the
  schema) row form that needs nothing new, then the typed-struct return once
  map-to-struct lands.

Transactions come straight from `sql.begin` / `commit` / `rollback`. Kept out of
v1: relations beyond a plain `join` (has-many / belongs-to eager loading wants
object identity and lazy proxies Jennifer does not have), and migrations (a thin
`orm.createTable(schema)` DDL emitter is a plausible follow-on, full migration
tooling is its own module). Needs the default binary. Discipline as usual: a
`modules/orm_test.j` overlay, docs, catalog, and demo - with the overlay split
so the **query-builder-to-SQL** surface (pure string generation) is covered 100%
offline, and live CRUD sits behind a DB-service-gated integration test rather
than the unit overlay.

### M21.6 - `font` module (TrueType / SFNT parsing)

A pure-`.j` font parser: read a TrueType / SFNT file from `bytes` and expose its
glyph outlines, metrics, and name tables. **No prerequisite** - it needs only the
shipped `bytes` type, the bitwise operators (`& | << >>`, for the big-endian table
offsets), and `fs` to load the file, so it could be built today. It is parked in
the backlog as a self-contained stress-test of how far pure Jennifer stretches,
and it is TinyGo-clean (no Go, so it runs on both binaries).

Named `font`, not `truetype`, for the one-module-selectable-backend rule (design
stance 1): the SFNT container also carries PostScript / CFF outlines, so v1 ships
the **TrueType `glyf` backend** and the module grows a CFF backend later, detected
on parse, rather than spawning a parallel `opentype` module.

Surface: `font.parse(b) -> font.Font` (or `font.open(path)`), then
`font.unitsPerEm(f)`, `font.name(f)`, `font.advance(f, codepoint)`,
`font.glyphPath(f, codepoint) -> string` (an SVG path `d`, in font-unit
coordinates), and `font.glyph(f, codepoint) -> font.Glyph` (contours of
on / off-curve points plus advance and bounding box) for callers that want the raw
outline. It parses the core tables - `head` (units-per-em, bounds), `cmap`
(formats 4 and 12), `maxp` / `hhea` / `hmtx` (advances), `loca` / `glyf` (simple
**and** composite glyphs, quadratic curves), and `name` (family) - enough to lay
out and outline a string.

**Concrete motivation:** this closes a dogfood gap. The wordmark generator
(`scripts/genwordmark.py`) had to reach for Python's `fontTools` for the one thing
Jennifer could not do - turn `jennifer` into vector path data from the TTF - so
with `font` in hand that becomes `scripts/genwordmark.j`, outlining and laying out
the wordmark entirely in Jennifer.

Kept out of v1: CFF / PostScript outlines (cubic curves, the second backend),
hinting, shaping and kerning beyond `hmtx` (GPOS / GSUB), colour / emoji tables,
and variable-font axes. Graduates into the M18 module track when built. Discipline
as usual: a `modules/font_test.j` overlay (parse a small committed `.ttf` fixture -
assert units-per-em, a known glyph's advance and path `d`, and a couple of `cmap`
lookups), `docs/modules/font.md`, a catalog row, a `SUMMARY.md` entry, a
`modules/README.md` entry, a `JENNIFER.md` bullet, and a runnable
`examples/modules/font_demo.j` (a word rendered to an SVG path).

## Requirements for 1.0.0 stable

The core CI + release + packaging items that used to live here
were promoted into M15.8 (the last step before Phase C). What
stays here are the distribution requirements for a stable 1.0.0
that aren't themselves milestones - they can land any time and
don't block any feature milestone:

- **Cross-build for macOS / Windows.** Waits on the
  platform-portability work in the [horizon ideas](horizon.md); ships as
  soon as that lands.
- **Real apt repository** (replacing the "GitHub Release
  artifact" install of the M15.8 `.deb`) if user demand
  warrants the maintenance.

The extra Linux / macOS distribution formats (Homebrew, Snap,
Nix, Flatpak, AppImage, ...) are not requirements; they live in
the [horizon idea collection](horizon.md) and ship when there's
user demand and a maintainer willing to keep one green.

## Long horizon

Ideas for development *beyond* 1.0.0 - embedding, a WASM runtime,
specialised-domain libraries, and a grab-bag of smaller possibilities -
live in their own collection, kept out of the near-term plan so this file
stays focused on the road to 1.0.0. See the
[beyond-1.0.0 idea collection](horizon.md).
