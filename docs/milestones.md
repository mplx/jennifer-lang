# Jennifer - Milestones

Development is split into milestones. Each milestone produces a *working*
interpreter that runs a strictly larger subset of the language.

---

## M1 - End-to-end MVP

**Status:** done.

Smallest vertical slice that proves the pipeline (source → tokens →
preprocessed tokens → AST → result):

- Types: `int`, `string`
- `def x as int init 5;`, `$var` references, method defs (zero-arg, top
  level), `import "file.j";`, `use io;`, single-arg `printf`
- Arithmetic `+ - * / %` on ints; comments `#` and `/* */`
- Source-context caret in error messages
- Golden-file integration test and TinyGo build verified

**Exit criterion:** `./jennifer run examples/hello.j` prints `42`.

---

## M2 - Types, constants, scoping, control flow

**Status:** done.

Rounds out the "ordinary" feature set:

- New types `float`, `null`, `bool` with literals `3.14`, `null`, `true`,
  `false`
- Uninitialized `def x as T;` gives `T`'s zero value
- `def const NAME as TYPE init VALUE;` (reassignment is an error)
- Nested block scoping; inner scopes cannot redeclare visible names
- Assignment statement `$x = EXPR;`
- Comparison `< > <= >= ==`, `+` for string concat, `int`↔`float`
  promotion
- Escape parsing in `'...'` strings (previously only `"..."`)
- Control flow: `if`/`elseif`/`else`, `while`, `for`, all requiring
  `bool` conditions (no implicit truthiness)

---

## M3 - Methods with parameters and return values

**Status:** done.

- `func name(a as int, b as string) { ... }` with typed parameters,
  by-value argument passing, call-site arity + type checks
- `return;` and `return EXPR;`; recursion works
- `sprintf` and format verbs `%d %f %s %t %v %%` for both `printf` and
  `sprintf`
- The omnibus `stdlib` retired in favor of topic-based libraries; `io`
  is the first.

---

## M4 - Polish & ergonomics

**Status:** done.

- Logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` (word-based, short-circuit)
- Unary minus
- Python-3 division: `/` always returns `float`; new `div` keyword for 
  floor division (`//` is taken by line comments)
- Floats always display with a decimal (`5.0`, not `5`) so the type
  stays visible
- New libraries (all `use`-gated): [`convert`](libraries/convert.md),
  [`math`](libraries/math.md), [`strings`](libraries/strings.md)
- Interpreter gained `RegisterConst` so libraries can expose constants
  (`PI`, `E`).

---

## M5 - Interpreter improvements

**Status:** done.

- **Cross-file error sources** - errors raised inside an imported `.j`
  display the line from the imported file. See
  [technical/interpreter.md > Errors and positions](technical/interpreter.md#errors-and-positions-cross-file).
- **REPL** - `jennifer repl`, persistent globals/methods/imports across
  inputs, multi-line input via brace balancing, expression results
  printed. See [technical/cli_repl.md > REPL](technical/cli_repl.md#repl-cmdjenniferreplgo).
- **REPL line editor** - cursor keys, Home/End, word motions, Ctrl+W /
  Ctrl+U / Ctrl+K, in-memory history (Up/Down), Ctrl+C cancel. Non-TTY
  stdin falls back to plain line reading. See
  [technical/cli_repl.md > Line editor](technical/cli_repl.md#line-editor-cmdjenniferlineeditgo-cmdjenniferhistorygo).
- **Auto-loaded `core` library** - new library kind, pre-imported at
  startup; writing `use core;` is a runtime error. Contents:
  `JENNIFER_VERSION` (a `git describe`-derived build-version constant)
  and `len` (polymorphic over strings now; lists/maps in M6). `len`
  moved here from `strings`. (M15.4 later promoted `len` to a
  language built-in and deleted `core`; see M15.4 for the
  migration.) Version injection details at
  [technical/cli.md](technical/cli.md#version-injection).
- **Formatter** - `jennifer fmt` re-emits canonical source per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md). Token-level walker so file imports and
  user-written parentheses survive. See
  [technical/cli_fmt.md > Formatter](technical/cli_fmt.md#formatter-cmdjenniferfmtgo).
- **Inspection subcommands** - `jennifer tokens <file>` dumps the lexer
  output; `jennifer ast <file>` dumps the preprocessed AST as JSON.
  See [technical/cli_inspect.md > Inspection](technical/cli_inspect.md#inspection-tokens-and-ast).
- **Underscore-in-constants** - constant names became `[A-Z]+(_[A-Z]+)*`,
  enabling `MAX_RETRIES` and the `JENNIFER_VERSION` rename. See
  [technical/lexer.md > Identifier rule](technical/lexer.md#identifier-rule).
- **Documentation overhaul** - `docs/technical.md` split into
  `docs/technical/<topic>.md`; `docs/lib_*.md` moved to
  `docs/libraries/`; new `docs/user-guide/style-guide.md`.

---

## M6 - Lists and maps

**Status:** done.

Two new compound types - `list` and `map` - plus the strings library
functions deferred until compound types existed.

- **Syntax**: `def xs as list of int init [1, 2, 3];`,
  `def m as map of string to int init {"a": 1};`. Index read/write
  `$xs[i]`, `$m["k"]`, chains `$g[i][j]`. Iteration via
  `for (def x in $coll) { ... }` (new keyword `in`). New tokens
  `[ ] :` and keywords `list`, `map`, `of`, `to`, `in`.
- **Semantics**: value-typed (copy on assignment and on
  function-parameter binding; no aliasing); `const` is deep
  (`$NUMS[0] = ...` is a runtime error if `NUMS` is `const`);
  out-of-bounds list reads/writes and missing map keys are positioned
  runtime errors; map iteration is insertion-order deterministic.
- **Type system**: `parser.Type` became a recursive struct
  (`Element`, `KeyType`, `ValType` `*Type` slots), so nesting like
  `list of list of int` falls out without depth cap. 3+ levels is a
  documented code smell.
- **Stdlib**: `core.len` extended to lists and maps; `core.has(m, key)`
  for membership tests; `strings.split`, `strings.chars`,
  `strings.join` finished.
- **Tooling**: formatter handles `[...]` / `{...}` per
  [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md) (no inner padding, space after `,`/`:`,
  block-vs-map disambiguation via a small brace stack); AST JSON
  emitter handles `ListLit`, `MapLit`, `IndexExpr`, `IndexAssignStmt`,
  `ForEachStmt`.

See [user-guide/types-and-values.md > Lists and maps](user-guide/types-and-values.md#lists-and-maps) for
the user-facing tour, and
[technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) /
[technical/interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md) for the
implementation contract.

## M7 - printf modifiers, stdin input, comment/division swap

**Status:** done.

A breaking syntax change to free up `//` for integer division and to
allow shebangs, the long-promised format-verb modifier system, and
the first stdin-reading builtins.

- **Comments and integer division** (**BREAKING**). Line comments
  moved from `//` to `#`, freeing `//` for floor division (Python 3
  shape). `div` keyword removed. A Jennifer file can now begin with
  `#!/usr/bin/env -S jennifer run`.
- **`(s)printf` format-verb modifiers.** Each format verb except `%v`
  accepts a pipe-separated, order-independent flag list:
  `%verb[|key=value]*`. Modifiers shape *presentation* only - data
  transformations (`case=upper` on strings, markdown rendering, etc.)
  are explicitly out of scope; libraries do that work. Verbs gained:
  `pad`/`max`/`align`/`mode` (`%s`); `pad`/`fill`/`align`/`base`/
  `sign`/`group`/`sep` (`%d`); `prec`/`trim`/`sci`/`pad`/`align`/
  `sign` (`%f`); `case` (`%t`); shared `null=empty|null|literal(...)`
  across all four typed verbs. `%v` deliberately takes none.
- **Format-string breaking change.** `|` immediately after a verb
  now starts a modifier list. Pre-M7 strings with `|` as a literal
  separator (`"%d|%d"`) need either a different separator or the
  `||` escape (parallels `%%`).
- **`io` stdin input.** New builtins `readLine()`,
  `readLine(prompt)`, `eof()` - one-line-at-a-time reads with an
  explicit EOF predicate (`while (not eof()) { ... }`). Refuses
  inside the REPL since the line editor owns stdin.
- **Internals.** Builtin signature changed from
  `func(out io.Writer, args)` to `func(ctx BuiltinCtx, args)` so
  stdin and the REPL flag are plumbed symmetrically with stdout.
  Mechanical refactor across the ~30 existing builtins.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - full modifier and input reference.
- [technical/lexer.md](technical/lexer.md) and
  [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - the comment / division
  syntax change.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - what the modifier
  system deliberately doesn't do (data transformations, `%a`
  aggregate, `null=sql`/`null=skip`) and why the literal-pipe
  lookahead alternative was turned down.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Builtins and libraries](technical/interpreter.md#builtins-and-libraries) - the `BuiltinCtx` signature.

---

## M8 - System library namespacing

**Status:** done.

A hybrid namespace model so domain libraries can ship without
polluting the bare-name pool, plus the first real namespaced
library (`os`) so the machinery has a non-synthetic exercise.

- **Hybrid model.** Essential libraries (`io`, `convert`, `math`,
  `strings`, auto-loaded `core`) stay flat - their builtins are
  bare names. Domain libraries register through a new namespaced
  API (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) and are
  addressed by `prefix.name(...)` / `prefix.NAME`. The library's
  name doubles as the namespace prefix.
- **Qualified calls and constants.** New AST nodes
  `QualifiedCallExpr` and `QualifiedConstRefExpr`; parsed as
  `IDENT "." IDENT` (then `(` decides). Lookup is keyed by
  `(namespace, name)` and gated by `use lib;`.
- **`use NAME as ALIAS;` aliasing.** Optional `as` clause on
  `use`. Rename-not-addition: after `use bio as b;` only `b.`
  resolves, `bio.foo()` errors with a "did you mean `b`?" hint;
  the canonical name `bio` is freed for ordinary identifier use.
  Matches Python's `import foo as bar`. Aliasing is rejected for
  flat libraries (`use math as m;` errors as meaningless).
- **Namespace prefix is a reserved identifier.** After bare
  `use bio;`, `func bio() {}` errors with `shadows imported
  namespace 'bio'`. After `use bio as b;`, only `b` is reserved.
- **No migration.** The change is purely additive; all five flat
  essentials continue to work unchanged.
- **Demo library `os` (minimal slice).** First namespaced
  library: `os.platform() -> string`, `os.getEnv(name) -> string`,
  `os.JENNIFER_LF`, `os.JENNIFER_OS`. Two functions plus two
  constants - enough to exercise namespaced zero-arg calls,
  namespaced calls with arguments, namespaced constants, and
  aliasing end-to-end. Expands in M15.1.

See:
- [libraries/os.md](libraries/os.md) - the shipping demo library.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - flat vs namespaced
  policy and the rule for library authors.
- [user-guide/imports.md > Namespaced libraries and aliasing](user-guide/imports.md#namespaced-libraries-and-aliasing) -
  user-facing reference for `use NAME [as ALIAS];` and qualified
  calls.
- [user-guide/style-guide.md > Namespaced calls](user-guide/style-guide.md#namespaced-calls) -
  spacing convention around `.`.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF for
  `qualifiedCall` / `qualifiedConstRef` and the `use ... as ...`
  shape; AST table entries for the new nodes.
- [technical/interpreter.md > Namespaced libraries (M8)](technical/interpreter.md#namespaced-libraries-m8) -
  registration API, `nsPrefixes` / `nsAliasedAway` resolution
  tables, no-shadowing rule for namespace prefixes.

---

## M9 - Collection operations

**Status:** done.

Two new namespaced libraries cover the M6-deferred list/map
manipulation helpers, a small append sugar shortens the common
write pattern, and two follow-on breaking changes tidy up the
flat-vs-namespaced split.

- **`lists` library** (`use lists;`, namespaced). `lists.push`,
  `lists.pop`, `lists.first`, `lists.last`, `lists.head`,
  `lists.tail`, `lists.reverse`, `lists.sort`, `lists.contains`,
  `lists.concat`, `lists.slice`. Non-mutating - every function
  returns a new list. `sort` accepts numeric, string, or bool
  elements (mixed int/float promotes; other mixes error);
  comparator-based sort is deferred until methods are first-class.
- **`maps` library** (`use maps;`, namespaced). `maps.keys`,
  `maps.values`, `maps.has`, `maps.delete`, `maps.merge`. Same
  shape. `maps.delete` of a missing key errors (strict at
  boundaries, matching `$m[missing]`); `maps.merge` layers the
  second arg over the first.
- **Sugar: `$xs[] = item;`** - write-only target meaning "just past
  the end of the list". Equivalent to
  `$xs = lists.push($xs, item);`. Reads of `$xs[]` and chained
  forms (`$xs[0][]`) are parse errors; non-list targets error at
  runtime. New AST node `AppendStmt`.
- **BREAKING:** `has()` moved from `core` to `maps` as
  `maps.has(m, key)`. Bare `has(...)` callers now need
  `use maps;` and the qualified form. `has` was the only
  non-polymorphic name in core; `len` stays because it genuinely
  spans string / list / map.
- **BREAKING:** `strings` library moved from flat to namespaced.
  `upper(s)` → `strings.upper(s)`, `contains(s, sub)` →
  `strings.contains(s, sub)`, etc. across all 15 functions.
  `use strings;` itself is unchanged. The M8 library-author rule
  named exactly these collision-prone verbs (`contains`, `split`,
  `replace`, `join`); acting on it now keeps callers off the wrong
  shape before more libraries arrive. After M9 the remaining flat
  libraries are `io`, `convert`, `math`, and auto-loaded `core`.

See:
- [libraries/lists.md](libraries/lists.md) /
  [libraries/maps.md](libraries/maps.md) - function reference for
  each new library.
- [libraries/strings.md](libraries/strings.md) - now namespaced
  (M9 migration note at top).
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - updated flat-vs-namespaced
  catalog and the library-author rule.
- [user-guide/imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) and

  user-facing reference.
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - EBNF and AST entry
  for `AppendStmt`.

---

The next phase splits into four arcs after two architectural
prerequisites: M10 lands the namespace-first library architecture
that the rest of the standard library will be built on; Phase A
(M11-M13) finishes the language so libraries have something to
stand on; M14 closes the lexer-side gap (`fmt` losing comments
and shebangs) so the first wave of struct-using libraries can
ship with doc-comments intact; Phase B (M15.x) ships the
foundational libraries that every Jennifer program needs,
finishing with **M15.8 - the first public release** (CI, prebuilt
binaries, .deb / pacman / AUR packaging); Phase C (M16.x) ships
I/O libraries on top of the now-released foundation; Phase D
(M17-M20) ships the higher-level ecosystem (Jennifer-coded
libraries, the module system that unblocks them, crypto, a
server). Phase E (WASM and specialised domains) is the long
horizon.

The library milestones use sub-numbering (M15.1, M15.2, ...) so
each library ships and is reviewed independently. This is the
first time we use sub-milestones; the practice is justified
because each library is small enough to land in a single sitting
once the language foundation is in place.

---

## M10 - Namespace-first library architecture

**Status:** done.

A pre-language-completion API-shape correction: every library is
now namespaced, with bare-name globals reserved as a narrow
`core`-only exception. Small implementation surface, large API
shape; pre-1.0 is the window for this kind of change.

- **BREAKING:** `io`, `math`, `convert` migrate to
  namespaced-only. `printf(x)` → `io.printf(x)`,
  `sqrt(x)` → `math.sqrt(x)`, etc. The "io is special, keep
  it flat" alternative was considered and rejected at kickoff
  to keep a uniform "every call carries its library name"
  rule. `strings`, `lists`, `maps`, `os` were already
  namespaced (M9/M8).
- **BREAKING:** `convert`'s four conversion callees are renamed
  to `convert.toInt`, `convert.toFloat`, `convert.toString`,
  `convert.toBool` so they don't collide with the type
  keywords (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`); `convert.typeOf`
  keeps its name. The `to`-prefix also reads as English
  ("convert to int") at the call site.
- **BREAKING:** file-splice keyword `import` → `include`.
  `include "x.j";` is the textual splice; the `import`
  keyword is reserved for the M17 module system and produces
  a migration-hint error today. Mixing-mistake diagnostics
  updated.
- **BREAKING for embedders:** registration API renamed.
  `Register` / `RegisterConst` → `RegisterGlobal` /
  `RegisterGlobalConst`, making their role explicit ("expose
  this name globally"). The namespaced API
  (`RegisterNamespaced` / `RegisterNamespacedConst`) keeps
  its name and is the recommended default. Per-library
  storage (`globalFnsByLib`, `globalConstsByLib`) so two
  libraries with the same global name can no longer silently
  overwrite each other at Install time; the resolution map
  is populated by `processImports` when a library activates.
- **`math` absorbs the planned non-crypto random helpers**:
  `math.rand()`, `math.randInt(lo, hi)`, `math.randSeed(n)`.
  Three functions don't justify their own library under the
  new threshold (next bullet); pseudo-random fits `math`'s
  pure-numeric charter. The crypto-grade variant still ships
  in M20.1 `crypto`. The originally planned M14.2 `random`
  library is removed.
- **`core` is the only library publishing bare-name globals.**
  `len` and `JENNIFER_VERSION` only - no `core.len` /
  `core.JENNIFER_VERSION` qualified form, because shipping the
  same name two ways violates stance #1. `core` is the
  auto-loaded escape hatch, and its asymmetric exposure is
  the whole point.
- **Three globals-publishing rules in `processImports`**, all
  forward-looking (inert today since `core` is the only
  globals-publishing library and can't be `use`d):
  1. Duplicate `use` of a globals-publishing library is
     rejected (`library 'X' already in scope`); REPL no-ops a
     repeat.
  2. `use X as Y;` where `X` has globals but no namespaced
     names is rejected as meaningless.
  3. Two active libraries publishing the same global name are
     rejected at the second `use`
     (`library "B" collides with already-active library "A"
     on global "VER"`). The pre-M10 flat-only-alias-meaningless
     check is removed for the general case but kept as rule 2.
- **Library-author guidance updated.** The
  `docs/libraries/index.md` "flat vs namespaced" framing is
  retired; the new policy is "every library is namespaced;
  only `core` ships globals via `RegisterGlobal`." The
  "deserves its own library" threshold is raised from M8's
  "3+" to **"5+ functions or constants"**: anything smaller
  folds into the most-related existing library. The non-crypto
  random helpers (3 functions) are the first case the new rule
  caught.

See:
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md),
  [libraries/math.md](libraries/math.md),
  [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md) - migrated library
  references.
- [libraries/index.md](libraries/index.md) - retired
  flat-vs-namespaced framing; new library-author policy and
  5+ threshold.
- [user-guide/imports.md](user-guide/imports.md) - `use` and
  `include` keyword reference; namespaced-call and aliasing
  rules.
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `convert.toInt` / `convert.toFloat` example placement in the
  "explicit conversions" section.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - "Methods
  on structs" (M14.3 trigger; recorded here in M10's wake
  because M10's review touched the same call-shape question)
  and other related rejected alternatives.

No new language features land here - that's M11.

---

**Phase A: language completion (M11-M13).** These three milestones
close the biggest daily-use gaps and add the foundational types every
later library needs.

## M11 - Control-flow completion

**Status:** done.

Closes the biggest daily-use gap in the language and rounds out the
printf modifier table at the same time. Five new keywords (`break`,
`continue`, `repeat`, `until`, `exit`) and two new printf features.

- **`break;` / `continue;`** in every loop kind
  (`while`/`for`/`for-each`/`repeat`). Innermost loop only; misuse
  outside a loop or across a method-call boundary is a positioned
  runtime error. `continue` in C-style `for` still runs the step
  before re-checking the condition (matches C/Go).
- **`repeat { } until (cond);`** post-test loop. New keywords
  `repeat` and `until`; `do { } while ...` considered and rejected
  because the inverted condition is the whole point of switching
  to `until`.
- **`exit;` / `exit EXPR;`** terminate the whole program (exit code 0
  / EXPR-as-int). Distinct from `return` (method-scoped): skips every
  caller frame and remaining top-level statement. Implemented as an
  `ExitSignal` sentinel error the CLI translates into the OS exit
  status.
- **Bundled: printf `%s|align=center`** rounds out the align set.
  Rejected on every other typed verb (centred numbers break columnar
  output).
- **Bundled: printf `%a` aggregate verb** for lists and maps
  (deferred from M7; unblocked by M6 + M9). Modifiers: `sep`, `kv`,
  `open`, `close`, `depth=N`, `null=skip`. The modifier-list parser
  was extended with a `"..."` quoted-value form (`%a|sep=", "`) so
  values can contain spaces / reserved characters; standard
  `\n \r \t \\ \"` escapes.
- **Post-dot name relaxation.** Reserved words read as identifiers in
  the name slot of a qualified call (`strings.repeat`,
  `lists.break` if anyone wrote one), preserving the `strings.repeat`
  library function after `repeat` was reserved as a loop keyword.

See:
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  `repeat`/`until`, `break`/`continue` scope rules, `exit` vs
  `return`.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `%a` modifier table,
  `%s|align=center` example, quoted modifier values.
- [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md) - `%a|json=*` /
  `%a|xml=*` / `%a|yaml=*` (serialisation modifiers stayed rejected
  even after `%a` itself shipped) and the
  `do { } while` shape for the post-test loop.

## M12 - Bytes and bit operators

**Status:** done.

Adds the buffer-shaped primitive and the bit-twiddling vocabulary
the standard library needs for hashing, encoding, crypto, and
network code in later milestones.

- **New primitive type `bytes`** - mutable byte sequence; value
  semantics on assignment / parameter binding; deep-const. Reads
  yield `int` in `[0, 255]`; writes accept the same range and
  reject anything else. Append via the existing M9 `$b[] = byte;`
  sugar. `len($b)` returns the byte count.
- **New `convert.bytesFromString(s, codec)` and
  `convert.stringFromBytes(b, codec)`** - bytes ↔ string codecs.
  Only `"utf-8"` today (further codecs ship in M15.7 `encoding`).
  Invalid UTF-8 input is an error - no silent replacement
  characters.
- **Bit operators on `int`**: `& | ^ ~ << >>`. Python-style
  precedence (comparison < `|` < `^` < `&` < shifts < `+ -`),
  so `$x & 0xff == 0` parses as `($x & 0xff) == 0`. `~` is
  bitwise NOT. Shifts are arithmetic; negative count rejected;
  count >= 64 saturates to 0 / -1. `^` ships as a primitive
  operator (CPU primitive with unique algebraic properties -
  same justification `-` has against being composable from `+`
  and unary `-`).
- **Non-decimal integer literals**: hex `0xff`, octal `0o755`,
  binary `0b1010_0110`. `_` accepted between digits in any base
  (including decimal `1_000_000` and float mantissas). Never
  adjacent to the prefix or another `_`. Lexer-only change.
- **Resolves M7-deferred stdin builtins**:
  `io.readBytes(n) -> bytes` (exact n; partial at EOF then
  `io.eof()` becomes true) and `io.readChars(n) -> string`
  (n runes, UTF-8 decoded). Both compose with M7's `io.eof()`
  unchanged.

See:
- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md) -
  `bytes` type, value semantics, index-write rules.
- [libraries/convert.md](libraries/convert.md) - codec functions,
  UTF-8 strictness.
- [libraries/io.md](libraries/io.md) - `io.readBytes`,
  `io.readChars`.
- [user-guide/control-flow.md](user-guide/control-flow.md) -
  bit-operator precedence table.
- [user-guide/syntax.md](user-guide/syntax.md) - non-decimal
  literals + digit separator.

## M13 - Structs and catchable errors

**Status:** done.

The composite-data milestone, batched into two sub-milestones in
dependency order: M13.1 ships the struct mechanism, M13.2 ships
the error-handling design that uses it. Together they unblock
every library that wants composite returns and give the language
a recoverable-error story.

## M13.1 - Structs / records

**Status:** done.

- `def struct Name { field as type, ... };` at top level
  (hoisted before the first statement; duplicate names error in
  `Run`, silently redefine in the REPL).
- Literals `Name{ field: expr, ... }` with every field required;
  `def x as Name;` (no init) zero-fills, recursing through
  nested struct fields.
- Field read `$p.field`, write `$p.field = ...;`. Lvalue chains
  mix `[index]` and `.field` freely (`$L.from.x = 5;`,
  `$bag.items[0] = 99;`); index-assign and field-assign share
  one walker.
- Value semantics like lists/maps; `const` deep at any depth.
- Strict at boundaries: unknown struct type, missing / unknown
  field at literal, field-type mismatch on write, field access
  on a non-struct value are all positioned errors.

- [user-guide/types-and-values.md](user-guide/types-and-values.md#structs) -
  language angle.
- [technical/interpreter.md](technical/interpreter.md#structs-m131) -
  runtime details (`KindStruct`, hoisting, unified lvalue walker).
- [technical/grammar.md](technical/grammar.md) - `structDef`,
  `structLit`, `fieldAssign`, mixed-tail lvalues.
- `examples/structs.j` standalone; `examples/showcase.j`
  `=== M13.1 structs ===` section.

## M13.2 - `try` / `catch` / `throw`

**Status:** done.

Catchable errors. New keywords `try`, `catch`, `throw`. Depends
on M13.1 because the canonical error value is a struct.

- `try { body } catch (NAME) { handler }` runs the body and, on
  a catchable error, binds the thrown value to `$NAME` in a
  fresh per-handler scope.
- `throw EXPR;` raises any value; convention is the auto-hoisted
  `Error{kind, message, file, line, col}` struct.
- Runtime errors (out-of-bounds, missing key, type mismatch,
  etc.) are wrapped into the canonical `Error` shape on entry
  to the catch (`kind` defaults to `"runtime"` until sites
  opt in to specific tags); user code catches both kinds
  uniformly. `throw $err;` inside a catch re-raises to the
  enclosing `try`.
- **Not** catchable: `exit` (program-level escape, propagates
  through `try`); `return` / `break` / `continue` (control
  flow, flow through `try` unchanged).
- No `finally` and no typed catch in v1.
- Internals: `ErrorSignal` sentinel parallels `ExitSignal`;
  `runtimeError.Kind` field threads the symbolic tag; user code
  may not redefine the auto-hoisted `Error` struct.

## M14 - Lexer comment + blank-line preservation

**Status:** done.

Closes the two M5-deferred items (`fmt drops comments`, `fmt
drops blank lines`). No language change - the runtime still
never sees comments.

- Lexer emits trivia tokens (`TOKEN_COMMENT_LINE`,
  `TOKEN_COMMENT_BLOCK`, `TOKEN_COMMENT_SHEBANG`,
  `TOKEN_BLANK_LINE`). Shebang on line 1 col 1 is its own kind;
  runs of blank lines collapse to one.
- Preprocessor and parser strip trivia at entry; `jennifer fmt`
  walks the raw lexer stream and re-emits trivia via a dedicated
  `emitTrivia` path that doesn't disturb the surrounding state
  machine.
- Block comments nest via depth counter; unterminated comments
  error at the outermost `/*`.
- Token-level over AST-level: the original spec proposed
  AST-attached `LeadingComments` / `TrailingComment` slots and a
  `jennifer ast --with-comments` flag - dropped in favour of the
  simpler token-level path. Add them back if a future doc
  generator needs structured per-statement attachment.

See:
- [user-guide/style-guide.md](user-guide/style-guide.md#comments) -
  Comments section (block comments nest; inline-comment spacing
  exception).
- [technical/lexer.md](technical/lexer.md#comments) - trivia
  emission, shebang detection, nesting depth counter.
- [technical/cli_fmt.md](technical/cli_fmt.md) - `fmt`'s trivia re-emission.

**Phase B: foundational libraries (M15.x).** Small,
frequently-used libraries grouped under M15 with sub-numbering.
The leading M15.0 slot is the "wrap-up of existing libraries"
(extensions to M8 / M9 / M10 libraries that depend on language
features added since); later slots ship a new library each.
M15.8 closes the phase by making the result installable before
Phase C starts adding I/O on top.

## M15 - foundational libraries + first public release

**Status:** done. All nine sub-milestones shipped. Three are
language work (M15.2, M15.4), the rest are library / tooling /
release work. Two recurring patterns surfaced in the shipped
APIs and are worth remembering:
- **Codec-table shape** (algorithm/format/codec passed as a
  string argument). Used by `hash.compute(b, algo)`,
  `crc.compute(b, algo)`, `encoding.encode(s, codec)`,
  `encoding.toText(b, format)`. Originally adopted because
  Jennifer's letters-only identifier rule rejects digits in
  method names (so `hash.md5(...)` won't parse), but it also
  honours stance #1 by collapsing parallel verbs into one.
- **Integer-handle struct for opaque resources** (M15.2's
  namespaced-struct mechanism + a single `id as int` field
  indexing into a Go-side map). Used by `os.Process`,
  `hash.Stream`, `crc.Stream`.

### M15.0 - existing-library extensions

**Done.** Two extensions to the M9 `lists` library that needed
post-M14 language features: `lists.shuffle(xs)` (Fisher-Yates,
respects `math.randSeed`) and `lists.range(start, end[, step])`
(half-open, deliberate single-arg omission per stance #2). See
[libraries/lists.md](libraries/lists.md#shuffle) and
[technical/design-decisions.md > Half-open ranges](technical/design-decisions.md#half-open-ranges)
for the half-vs-closed-range rationale.

### M15.1 - `os` + `meta` (process metadata)

**Done.** Reshapes the M8-era `os` surface around one rule:
immutable per-run host facts are uppercase constants
(`PLATFORM`, `ARCH`, `EOL`, `DIRSEP`, `PATHSEP`, `ARGS`),
operations are functions (`getEnv`, `hasFlag`, `flag`). Drops
the `JENNIFER_` prefix that only made sense for bare-global use,
and introduces a new `meta` library for interpreter-self-identity
constants (`VERSION`, `BUILD`). CLI forwards trailing args to
`os.ARGS` (script path at index 0). Breaking renames
(`JENNIFER_VERSION` -> `meta.VERSION`, `os.platform()` ->
`os.PLATFORM`, `os.JENNIFER_OS` -> `os.PLATFORM`,
`os.JENNIFER_LF` -> `os.EOL`); old names now produce plain
"undefined" errors with no rename-hint. See
[libraries/os.md](libraries/os.md) and
[libraries/meta.md](libraries/meta.md).

### M15.2 - Language: library-provided namespaced struct types

**Done.** Language work slotted inside Phase B because the next
wave of libraries (M15.3 `os.{Result,Process}`, M15.5 `time.*`,
M15.6 `hash.Stream`/`crc.Stream`, future M16.1 `fs`, M16.2 `net`)
all need their own struct types and M13.1 only handled bare-IDENT
names. Adds `def x as lib.Name;` type syntax,
`lib.Name{field: ...}` literals, and the Go-side
`Interpreter.RegisterNamespacedStruct` API. Reuses M13.1's value
semantics, deep-`const`, and strict-boundary machinery; only the
resolution path differs. User code can't register structs (Go-side
only); methods on structs and inheritance stay out of scope. See
[technical/interpreter.md > Library-provided namespaced structs](technical/interpreter.md#library-provided-namespaced-structs-m152).

### M15.3 - `os` external-program execution

**Done.** First library to consume the M15.2
namespaced-struct mechanism. Surface: `os.Result {exitCode,
stdout, stderr}` + `os.Process {pid}` as the public types;
`os.run(argv) -> Result` blocking, `os.spawn(argv) -> Process`
non-blocking, `os.wait/poll/kill(p)` for handle ops. `argv` is
always `list of string` (no shell parsing; explicit
`["sh", "-c", $cmd]` for that hop). Non-zero exit codes are
values, not errors. **TinyGo limitation**: TinyGo's runtime
doesn't implement `os/exec`, so the constrained `jennifer-tiny`
binary returns a friendly "use the default `jennifer` binary" error
instead of panicking - first place the two-binary story becomes
user-visible. See
[libraries/os.md > External programs](libraries/os.md#external-programs)
and `examples/exec.j`.

### M15.4 - Language: `len` built-in, `core` removed

**Done.** Promoted `len(EXPR)` from the auto-loaded `core` library
to a reserved keyword + language primary expression (polymorphic
over string / list / map / bytes). Deleted `internal/lib/core/`
entirely; `use core;` now returns a friendly migration error
pointing at the built-in and at `meta.VERSION` / `meta.BUILD`.
Stance #2 ("explicit over implicit") now applies uniformly: every
library name lives behind a `use NAME;` prefix, no exceptions. See
[technical/design-decisions.md > len is a language built-in](technical/design-decisions.md#len-is-a-language-built-in-not-a-library).

### M15.5 - `time`

**Done.** One opt-in library spanning instants, durations,
fixed-offset zones, strftime format/parse, and ISO 8601
round-trip. Three namespaced structs: `time.Time {nanos, offset}`
(fields private API), `time.Duration {nanos}`, and
`time.Zone {offset, name}` (fields public, so an IANA / DST
companion can build them). Granularity (date-only
vs time-of-day-only) is a property of formatting, not the value
type. Unix timestamps are constructor / accessor pairs, not a
separate type. IANA names and DST are out of the fixed-offset
core - a Go-backed `time`-library extension, not a `.j` data map
(see the Long-horizon "`time`: IANA / DST zones" entry). Three
sub-milestones: **M15.5.1** core type + Unix + calendar + 1-based
ISO weekday + arithmetic / comparison; **M15.5.2** strftime
format/parse (chosen over Go's reference-time style for
familiarity; v1 verbs `%Y %m %d %H %M %S %z %a %A %b %B %j %u
%%`) + `time.zone(offset, name)` + `time.inZone` + the `time.UTC`
constant coexisting with the `time.utc()` function via
case-sensitive lookup + `time.iso` / `time.fromIso` RFC 3339
round-trip; **M15.5.3** the `examples/benchmark.j` side-by-side
TinyGo-vs-Go workload suite (eight workloads; the original spec's
"Sieve of Eratosthenes" became trial-division because Jennifer's
value-semantic list mutation turns the sieve into O(N^2)). See
[libraries/time.md](libraries/time.md),
`examples/time{,-format,benchmark}.j`.

### M15.6 - `hash` and `crc`

**Done.** Two opt-in libraries with parallel surfaces: `hash`
for cryptographic-style digests (`"md5"`, `"sha1"`, `"sha256"`),
`crc` for non-cryptographic checksums (`"crc32"` IEEE, `"crc64"`
with Go's `crc64.ECMA` polynomial). Output is raw `bytes`
(big-endian 4 / 8 bytes for CRC, natural width for hash). The
split keeps "transport integrity" vs "content addressing"
visible at the import line and matches Go's `crypto/*` vs
`hash/crc*` arrangement. Both libraries ship the codec-table
shape: `compute(b, algo)` one-shot, `stream(algo)` +
`update($s, $b)` + `finalize($s) -> bytes` for chunked input.
Streaming reuses the
[integer-handle pattern from `os.Process`](#m153---os-external-program-execution).
No convenience wrappers like `hash.md5String` or `hash.computeHex`
(stance #1; users compose `convert.bytesFromString` and
`encoding.toText`). Struct hashing deferred (needs stable byte
serialization, its own design problem). See
[libraries/hash.md](libraries/hash.md),
[libraries/crc.md](libraries/crc.md), `examples/hash.j`.

### M15.7 - `encoding`

**Done.** Three-part surface: introspection
(`isAscii`/`lenBytes`/`lenRunes`), binary-to-text
(`toText`/`fromText` for `"hex"`/`"base64"`/`"base64-url"`), and
character codecs (`encode`/`decode`/`codecs`). The cross-kind
UTF-8 pair stays in `convert` (M12); `encoding` owns the
table-based codec proliferation. Four codecs ship: `"ascii"`,
`"iso-8859-1"`, `"windows-1252"`, `"ebcdic"`. The spec's per-format
verbs (`encoding.hex`, `encoding.base64`, ...) consolidated into
the codec-table pair to dodge the same digit-in-identifier rule
M15.6 hit. Codec names and format strings are exact-match (the one
canonical spelling only; the original alias / case normalisation was
later dropped as a strictness lift, stance #2).
Windows-1252's five canonically-undefined positions (0x81, 0x8D,
0x8F, 0x90, 0x9D) reject symmetrically on encode and decode.
Long-tail single-byte codecs (ISO-8859-{2..16},
Windows-{1250,1251,1253..1258}) later shipped in
[M16.15](#m1615---encoding-completion), generated from the Unicode
mapping files. See
[libraries/encoding.md](libraries/encoding.md),
`examples/encoding.j`.

### M15.8 - distribution + first public release

**Done.** Packaging / CI / release-engineering only; no
`.j`-source language change. Four sub-phases:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`, `release.yml`). PR gate
  runs `go vet` + `gofmt` + `go test ./...` + `make build` +
  per-binary smoke run + repo-wide em-dash scan. Release
  triggers on bare-semver tags (`[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*`, no `v`
  prefix per project convention), cross-compiles both binaries
  for `linux/{amd64,arm64}` from one runner, QEMU-smoke-tests
  the non-native arch, runs the benchmark on amd64 so release
  notes carry fresh numbers, publishes a draft Release.
- **Packaging** under `packaging/{debian,arch,mime,man}/`.
  `scripts/build-deb.sh` produces the `.deb` (binaries +
  gzipped man pages + shared `text/x-jennifer` MIME definition
  + `update-mime-database` hooks). AUR ships `PKGBUILD-bin`
  (release tarball) and `PKGBUILD-git` (source-tracking) with
  a shared `.install` hook. Release pipeline auto-fills
  `PKGBUILD-bin` (real `pkgver` + real `sha256sums_*`) as a
  release asset so the AUR push is a one-step `curl`. The
  `.pacman` standalone artefact from the original spec was
  dropped - `PKGBUILD-bin` + `makepkg` covers the same need.
- **Docs site** via mdBook 0.5.3 (pinned, fetched via direct
  curl from `rust-lang/mdBook` releases - no third-party
  action). `book.toml` at repo root, `src = "docs"`,
  `docs/SUMMARY.md` maps the existing tree into five parts,
  `docs/introduction.md` is the docs-site landing
  (README stays GitHub-repo-focused). `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
  publishes to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- **User-facing install docs**. README gained "Which binary?" +
  "Install" sections with one command per path. `installing.md`
  restructured to put package paths first; build-from-source
  positioned as the developer path. `RELEASE.md` at the repo
  root documents the steps CI can't do (AUR SSH push,
  draft-publish review, pre-tag readiness checks).

**Conventions established (worth keeping)**:

- Bare semver tags (`0.14.1`, no `v` prefix); all pipelines pass
  the tag straight through.
- No top-level `LICENSE` file in v1 - the LGPL-3.0 text ships
  inline in `packaging/debian/copyright` (the form distros
  actually consume) + README links to gnu.org's canonical URL.

**One-time manual setup** before the first push to `main`: in
GitHub repo Settings -> Pages, set "Source" to "GitHub Actions"
so `docs.yml` can deploy.

**Stayed on the "Path to 1.0.0 distribution" parallel track**
(post-M15.8 polish, not gated on this milestone): Homebrew tap,
Snap, Nix flake, real apt repository, cross-build for macOS /
Windows (waits on platform-portability work first).

---

## M16 - I/O libraries and developer tooling

**Status:** done. Phase C: system libraries that touch the OS or do
significant compute, opened by a concurrency primitive (M16.0) that the
I/O libraries build on, then a developer-tooling trio (lint / profile /
test) and a run of self-contained data libraries. All sub-milestones
shipped; git history holds the full per-milestone specs.

### M16.0 - Lightweight concurrency

**Done.** `spawn { ... }` (block primary expression), `task of T` (new
compound kind), and the `task` library (`wait` / `poll` / `discard` /
`waitAll` / `waitAny`). Goroutine-backed but data-race-free by
construction: `snapshotForSpawn` deep-copies a two-frame globals+locals
snapshot at launch (tasks are the one carve-out from value semantics -
copies share the `TaskState` pointer). A per-run registry loud-fails
unobserved task errors at exit and bumps the exit code (a non-terminating
undiscarded spawn hangs at exit - the documented trade-off). `task.wait`
re-raises a body error at the wait site for `try`/`catch`; `waitAny` is
the runtime's only `reflect.Select`. The Makefile passes
`-stack-size=2mb -scheduler=tasks` to TinyGo. See
[concurrency.md](user-guide/concurrency.md), [task.md](libraries/task.md).

### M16.1 - `fs`

**Done.** Blocking filesystem I/O composed with `spawn` (no `*Async`
variants): whole-file `read`/`write`/`append` (String/Bytes), metadata
(`exists`/`isFile`/`isDir`/`stat` -> `fs.Stat`), directory ops with the
two-verb recursion split (`mkdir`/`mkdirAll`, `remove`/`removeAll`, plus
`rename`/`list`/`walk`), and buffered `fs.File` handles
(`open`/`readLine`/.../`close`; `eof` peeks one byte). Path- vs
handle-form verbs dispatch on first-arg kind; `fs.File` shares state
across copies (the handle carve-out from value semantics). See
[fs.md](libraries/fs.md).

### M16.2 - `net`

**Done.** TCP (`connect`/`listen`/`accept`/`readBytes`/`writeBytes`),
UDP (`listenUDP`/`sendTo`/`recvFrom`), and DNS
(`lookup`/`reverseLookup`); polymorphic `close`/`address` over three
handle registries. Blocking calls compose with `spawn`
(accept-loop-per-connection). Build-tag split: `jennifer-tiny` returns
friendly-error stubs (no netdev in TinyGo). See [net.md](libraries/net.md).

### M16.3 - `regex`

**Done.** RE2 (Go `regexp`, linear-time) over strings:
`matches`/`find`/`findAll`/`replace`/`split`/`escape`;
`regex.Match{text,start,end,groups,groupsNamed}` with rune indices and a
`start=-1` no-match sentinel; an implicit 128-entry LRU pattern cache.
Full surface in both binaries. See [regex.md](libraries/regex.md).

### M16.4 - `testing` (system-library primitives)

**Done.** The irreducible system-side surface a `.j` test framework needs:
`testing.run(name)` invokes a zero-arg user method via the new
`Interpreter.CallByName`, times it, and classifies every failure mode
into a `testing.Result`; `results`/`reset` manage a mutex-guarded
accumulator; `report` renders text / TAP / JUnit. The one place `exit` is
caught (at the Go level, so language `try`/`catch` still cannot). See
[testing.md](libraries/testing.md).

### M16.5 - Interpreter performance pass

**Done.** Five sub-milestones, user-visible behaviour unchanged: **.1**
shared-marker copy-on-write on compound Values (append-in-a-loop O(N^2)
-> amortised O(N)); **.2** parse-time lexical slot resolution
((Depth,Slot) coordinates + a `slots` slice, undefined/shadowing promoted
to parse-time errors); **.3** pooled + pre-resolved + slot-bound
method-call frames; **.4** namespaced-call / comparison / arg-bind /
root-cache fast paths; **.5** compile-time constant folding plus a
`Share()` scalar fast path. Numbers in [tinygo.md](technical/tinygo.md).

### M16.6 - Developer tooling: linting

**Done.** `jennifer lint` flags compile-legal-but-suspect patterns:
grouped IDs (**L0nn** source errors, always on / **L1nn** correctness /
**L2nn** style / **L3nn** lifecycle), `# lint-disable[-file]: IDS`
suppression, `--checks` / `.jennifer-lint` config, and human / JSON /
GitHub output (source errors render in the chosen format, so a JSON
pipeline stays valid); exit 0/1/2. `!tinygo`. See
[cli_lint.md](technical/cli_lint.md).

### M16.7 - Developer tooling: profiling

**Done.** `jennifer profile` attributes work to `.j` source positions
(what `go tool pprof` cannot): a statement profile (hit count +
self/cumulative wall-clock) and an `--allocs` value-copy profile; table /
pprof (hand-encoded gzipped protobuf) / Chrome-trace output; program
output goes to stderr so the profile owns stdout. `!tinygo`. See
[cli_profile.md](technical/cli_profile.md).

### M16.8 - Testing framework consolidation

**Done.** An assertion vocabulary on M16.4's primitives (`assertEqual`
... `assertThrows`, throwing `Error{kind:"assertion"}` at the call site),
`CallByNameWith`/`runWith` argument dispatch, and the `jennifer test`
subcommand (`test*` discovery or `--filter`, `setUp`/`tearDown`,
`--isolated` per-test subprocess, text/TAP/JUnit, exit 0/1/2). Builtins
can now raise a catchable Jennifer error via `interpreter.RaiseError`. See
[cli_test.md](technical/cli_test.md).

### M16.9 - `json`

**Done.** Hand-rolled RFC 8259 encode/decode onto the tagged-union Value
(no `encoding/json`, no reflect). `encode`/`encodePretty`/`decode`;
structs and `map of string to V` map to objects, `bytes` to base64,
numbers to `int` when integral else `float`. Also closed a type hole: a
generic collection (a fresh literal or decode result) is validated entry
by entry against the declared element type at every binding boundary.
Decode's return shape was later superseded by
[M16.16](#m1616---jsonvalue). See [json.md](libraries/json.md).

### M16.10 - `uuid`

**Done.** RFC 9562: `uuid.generate("v4")` (random) / `generate("v7")`
(time-ordered), the version tag a string argument (identifiers are
letters-only), plus `parse`/`isValid`/`version` and constant `NIL`.
Randomness draws from `math`'s shared seedable RNG (documented
non-crypto; swaps when M20.1 `crypto` lands). See [uuid.md](libraries/uuid.md).

### M16.11 - `compress`

**Done.** Byte-stream size reduction (distinct from `encoding`'s
representation codecs): `pack`/`unpack` for `"gzip"`/`"zlib"`/`"deflate"`
with an optional `"fast"`/`"default"`/`"best"` level, plus a streaming
`compress.Stream` handle. Go `compress/*`, TinyGo-clean. See
[compress.md](libraries/compress.md).

### M16.12 - `archive`

**Done.** tar / zip containers over `bytes` (no `fs`, value-semantic):
`pack`/`unpack` (verbs shared with `compress`) for
`"tar"`/`"zip"`/`"tar.gz"`; a bundle is a
`list of archive.Entry{name,data,mode,mtime}`. Go
`archive/tar`+`archive/zip`. See [archive.md](libraries/archive.md).

### M16.13 - `os.isTerminal`

**Done.** `os.isTerminal(stream)` (`"stdout"`/`"stderr"`/`"stdin"`) ->
bool, the gate for ANSI colour, via the character-device mode bit
(`os.ModeCharDevice`) - pure stdlib (keeps `x/term` CLI-scoped),
TinyGo-clean; an unstattable stream reports `false`. See
[os.md](libraries/os.md).

### M16.14 - `net` TLS

**Done.** `net.connectTLS(address)` (implicit TLS) and
`net.startTLS(conn)` (in-place STARTTLS upgrade), both yielding the
transport-agnostic `net.Conn`. Certificate verification is on by default,
with a `net.TLSOptions{skipVerify as bool, caCert as bytes}` opt-out. Go
`crypto/tls` on the `!tinygo` build (stubbed on `jennifer-tiny`). See
[net.md](libraries/net.md).

### M16.15 - `encoding` completion

**Done.** Filled out `encoding`: `toText`/`fromText` gained
`quoted-printable`, `base32`/`base32-hex`, `ascii85`, and `z85`; the full
ISO-8859-{1..16} / Windows-{1250..1258} single-byte codecs, generated
from the Unicode mapping files (`gen_codecs.go` -> `codecs_gen.go`) so
only `ascii`/`ebcdic` stay hand-written. Format and codec names are
exact-match (the normalisation layer was dropped as a strictness lift,
stance #2). See [encoding.md](libraries/encoding.md).

### M16.16 - `json.Value`

**Done.** The strict home for heterogeneous JSON without a language top
type: `json.decode` returns an opaque `json.Value` - the first
`KindObject` (the opaque sibling of `KindStruct`: discriminated by
`(namespace, name)`, minted only by a library, rejecting operators /
`[i]` / `.field`). `convert.typeOf` reports `"object"`,
`convert.objectType` the specific `"json.Value"`. Reads and non-mutating
writes share JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) addressing -
`typeOf`/`get`/`has`/`keys`/`length`/`as*`/`isNull` and
`map`/`list`/`set`/`insert`/`append`/`remove`/`move` (strict / no-vivify,
`-` end-marker), with node types in `list`/`map` vocabulary - and a
displayer hook renders a handle as its JSON. `json.decode`'s return type
changed (a pre-1.0 break) and the decoder's number grammar was tightened
to json.org. No `any` keyword (rationale in
[rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)). See [json.md](libraries/json.md).

---

**Phase D: higher-level and Jennifer-coded libraries (M17-M20).**

## M17 - Module system for Jennifer-coded libraries

Real modules, so Jennifer-coded libraries get their own namespace, scope,
and explicit exports. "Module" is the canonical term for a distributable
`.j` library (matching Python, ES2015, Rust). Two mechanisms coexist and
divide by pipeline stage: `include "x.j";` stays the **textual splice**
(preprocessor) for composing one module out of several files;
`import "x.j" as x;` is the new **module boundary** (parser + interpreter).

```jennifer
# points.j - a module
export def struct Point { x as int, y as int };

export func mid(a as Point, b as Point) {
    return Point{ x: ($a.x + $b.x) // 2, y: ($a.y + $b.y) // 2 };
}

func doubleCoord(v as int) { return $v * 2; }   # private: no export marker
```

```jennifer
# consumer.j
use io;
import "./points.j" as points;

def p as points.Point init points.Point{ x: 0, y: 10 };
io.printf("mid = %v\n", points.mid($p, points.Point{ x: 4, y: 6 }));
```

The settled, cross-cutting decisions (turned-down alternatives live in
[rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)):

- `import` is a parser + interpreter feature, not a preprocessor splice.
- Each module is its own resolution context: own `use` set, namespace
  tables, and export table.
- Module top level is **declarations-only** - no mutable module state - so
  `spawn` capture is unaffected (nothing mutable to snapshot).
- One global `Error` (M13.2 stands); modules add distinctly-named error
  structs, never redefine `Error`.
- **Private by default**; a leading `export` publishes a name. No
  `public` / `private` keyword.
- Multi-file modules assemble via `include` behind one entry file - no
  directory-as-module, no cross-file re-export.
- Modules need a filesystem; hosted `jennifer-tiny` loads them, an
  FS-less host fails with the ordinary search-path error.

Ships as four dependency-ordered submilestones (M17.1 resolution, M17.2
loader, M17.3 scope, M17.4 exports), then M17.5 dogfoods them with the
first real module. **M18.x cannot start until M17.1-M17.4 land.**

### M17.1 - Source tree and resolution

**Status:** done. The resolution layer shipped in `internal/module`
(`Classify` / `Resolve` + the sysmoddir precedence), wired to
`meta.SYSMODDIR`, `jennifer version -v`, and the `run` flags `--sysmoddir`
/ `-I`. The `import` statement that exercises the resolver end to end is
M17.2, so the "imports and runs" half of the acceptance below lands there;
M17.1's own acceptance (the three shapes + duplicate / missing errors,
sysmoddir precedence + validation, `meta.SYSMODDIR`, `version -v`) is met
and unit-tested in `internal/module/*_test.go`.

Where modules live on disk, and how an import string resolves to a file.

- **Layout.** A top-level `modules/` directory for Jennifer-coded
  modules; Go system libraries stay in `internal/lib/*/`. Distro
  packaging ships modules to `/usr/share/jennifer/modules/` (FHS
  read-only, arch-independent data), loadable without recompiling the
  interpreter.
- **OS-independent import paths.** The string is a *logical* path, always
  `/`-separated (like a URL or the `.j` string literal), never the host
  separator - a `\` in an import is a syntax error. The shape is
  classified on the logical string; the file is then located with
  `path/filepath`, so Windows `\`, drive letters, and mixed separators are
  the stdlib's job at resolve time, not the grammar's. Three shapes, by
  the *leading* token:
  - `import "./f.j"` / `"../f.j"` - **local**: relative to the importing
    file's directory; no search path consulted.
  - `import "/abs/f.j"` - **absolute**: exactly that file (detected with
    `filepath.IsAbs`, so a Windows `C:/f.j` counts), no search path.
    Non-relocatable by nature - prefer `-I` for machine-specific paths.
  - `import "f.j"` - **module**: walk the search path (system module dir,
    then each `-I DIR` in order); the importing file's directory is never
    consulted. `-I` values are OS-native shell paths, so `\` / drives are
    fine there.

  A `/` anywhere but the leading position is an ordinary path component,
  so all three shapes accept `sub/f.j`.
- **Multi-file modules.** One entry file (`modules/bigmod/bigmod.j`)
  `include`s its parts (subdirs allowed); the splice is one module scope
  and one export surface, and the consumer imports only the entry file.
- **System module dir.** `--sysmoddir` > `JENNIFER_SYSMODDIR` >
  compile-time default (baked via the Makefile codegen path, since TinyGo
  ignores `-ldflags -X`). Inspectable through `meta.SYSMODDIR` (resolved
  after argv/env, not a static const) and `jennifer version -v` (each
  layer tagged `cli` / `env` / `compile`).

**Decisions.** Path shapes are disjoint at the character level, so a
reader tells "local file" from "vetted module" without leaving the line;
working-directory-first search is a supply-chain footgun (rejected), so
system modules win over `-I`, and `-I` only *adds* names. Duplicate module
names across `-I` dirs (or `-I` vs system) are a hard error at load,
naming both paths. `--sysmoddir` / `JENNIFER_SYSMODDIR` are validated at
`Run()` (missing / non-dir refuses to start); the compile-time default is
best-effort, so a fresh checkout that imports nothing still runs. The bare
form (`import "sub/bigmod.j";`, no `as`) reserves the file stem
(`bigmod`) as the prefix. `../` in a local import is allowed - the
supply-chain rule targets the consumer's working directory, not
navigation within an author-controlled tree. No directory-as-module, no
cross-file re-export, no versioning / upgrade / signing (the distro or
`-I` places versions; the interpreter picks what it finds). TinyGo:
resolution needs `fs` (present under TinyGo), so a hosted `jennifer-tiny`
loads modules and an FS-less host fails with the ordinary search-path
error; a build-time `embed.FS` bundle is a deferred future option.

**Acceptance.** A module in `modules/bigmod/bigmod.j` that `include`s
`sub/extra.j` imports and runs under both binaries via each of the three
path shapes; the three sysmoddir sources resolve in precedence and surface
identically through `meta.SYSMODDIR` and `jennifer version -v`; duplicate
`-I` names and a missing named sysmoddir both error at `Run()`.

### M17.2 - Import statement and loader

**Status:** done.

The `import "..." as NAME;` statement end to end: pipeline placement,
one-time init, ordering, cycles, error surfacing.

- **Pipeline.** The preprocessor stops rejecting `import` and passes its
  tokens through (as it already does for `use`); `include` stays a
  preprocessor splice - the two keywords diverge cleanly by stage. The
  parser gains a `ModuleImportStmt` node (path + optional alias), distinct
  from the `use`-backed `ImportStmt`.
- **Loader + cache.** Loading a module lexes, preprocesses, parses,
  resolves, and executes it once against a fresh module scope, keyed by a
  **canonical** resolved path (`filepath.Abs` + `Clean`, case-folded on a
  case-insensitive filesystem) - so `Util.j` and `util.j` are one module
  scope. Run-once and cycle detection both depend on the key being
  canonical, not on the string the importer typed.

**Decisions.** **Run-once**: a module inits exactly once per program run;
later imports (any importer, any point) reuse the cached AST and
initialised namespace. Two aliases of one file share an instance; the same
relative name from two directories are two modules. **Init order is
depth-first post-order** - a module fully inits before any module that
imports it (script -> A -> B -> C inits C, B, A, then the script body),
each module's struct hoisting and `def const` initializers running once on
first reach. **Cycles are rejected**: the loader tracks in-progress
modules on the load stack and errors at load on reaching an in-progress
import, before any initializer in the cycle runs, naming each edge
(`module cycle: A -> B -> C -> A`); no Python-style partial init (fix by
factoring a shared module, Go's model; mirrors the M10 include-cycle
rejection). **Load-time errors are not catchable**: a `def const`
initializer that throws fails the program at load, before the importer's
body - `import` is a declaration, not an expression, so `try`/`catch`
cannot wrap it; parse errors surface positioned in the imported file.
`jennifer fmt` / `ast` / `tokens` preserve `import "..." as x;` textually,
same as `include`.

**Acceptance.** A three-module chain inits post-order exactly once each
(observable via a load-time `io.printf` in each initializer); a re-import
returns the cached instance without re-running init; an A->B->C->A cycle
errors at `Run()` naming every edge; a throwing initializer fails at load
and is not caught by a `try` around the `import`; `jennifer fmt`
round-trips an `import` line unchanged.

**As built.** The loader lives in `internal/interpreter/module.go` (the
`moduleReg` shared cache + load stack + search path, one fresh
sub-interpreter per module) and is wired onto the CLI in `main.go`'s
`runFile` via `EnableModules`. Each module loads into its own
sub-interpreter sharing the registry, so run-once, post-order init, and
cycle detection fall out of the recursion. `ModuleImportStmt.AsName` is
parsed and carried on the node but not yet **bound**: today an `import`
runs a module for its initialisation side effects. Binding `NAME.member`
to a module's exported surface is the job of M17.3 (module scope and
namespacing) and M17.4 (exports). Runnable demo: `examples/modules/`.
Coverage: `internal/interpreter/module_test.go` (post-order/run-once,
cycle, positioned parse error, load-time throw, imports-without-enable).

### M17.3 - Module scope and namespacing

What a module's top level may contain, how its names resolve, and how it
reaches other libraries and modules.

- **Per-module resolution context.** Each loaded module carries its own
  `nsPrefixes`, namespace tables, and private + export symbol tables in
  the module cache entry.
- **Declarations-only top level.** Exactly these forms - the three
  declaration forms take an optional leading `export`, the two import
  forms do not:
  - `def const NAME as TYPE init EXPR;` (export-able)
  - `def struct Name { ... };` (export-able)
  - `func name(...) { ... }` (export-able)
  - `use LIB [as ALIAS];`
  - `import "..." as NAME;`
- **Consumer-side qualified resolution** (`points.mid(...)`,
  `points.Point`) reuses the M10 namespacing machinery through the
  consumer's module-import table into the module's export table.

**Decisions.** **No mutable module state**: a mutable `def VAR ...;` at
module top level errors, as does any free-standing statement (bare
expression, assignment, `if` / `while` / `for` / `repeat`). A `def const`
initializer still runs once at load - "declarations-only" bounds statement
forms, not initializer evaluation; value-producing init is
`export def const T init buildTable();` calling a private `func`.
**`spawn` is unaffected**: with no mutable module state there is nothing
new to capture, so `snapshotForSpawn`'s two-frame model is unchanged and
module constants (deep-immutable) are safe to reference. **`use` is not
transitive**: a module's `use net;` gives the module `net.*`, but the
importer needs its own `use net;` - a module's implementation choices do
not leak into a consumer's namespace. **Bare type names resolve in the
module's own type table**: inside `points.j`, `func mid(a as Point, ...)`
checks against the module-local `Point` (identity `(points, Point)`); a
module names another module's type only through that module's prefix
(struct identity stays a `(namespace, name)` pair, M15.2). **One global
`Error`**: M13.2's reserved struct is canonical across every module and
never redefined; richer payloads are distinctly-named structs
(`export def struct ParseError { ... };`), and cross-module identity makes
`a.ParseError` and `b.ParseError` distinct. Scripts (via `jennifer run`)
keep top-level mutable `def` and free-standing statements - a script is a
single execution context with no importer.

**Acceptance.** A mutable `def` or a free-standing statement at module top
level is a positioned parse error; a `def const` initializer runs once at
load; a module using `use net;` internally works while its importer
without `use net;` cannot call `net.*`; a struct made in a module and
passed back to a module `func` type-checks; a `spawn` body calling a
module `func` behaves identically to the serial call under `-race`.

### M17.4 - Exports and visibility

Which top-level names cross the module boundary, and the script-vs-module
and test-overlay rules that follow. This submilestone touches parser
grammar (the `export` keyword), so it ships last; M17.1-M17.3 are tooling,
loading, and resolution.

- **`export` marker** on a top-level `def const` / `def struct` / `func`
  publishes the name; unmarked names are module-private. One marker, one
  direction.
- **Referential-closure check**: an exported struct field (or exported
  `func` parameter / return) whose type is a *private* struct errors at
  the export-annotation site.
- **Cross-module struct identity** `(module-prefix, name)` (extends
  M15.2).
- **`MODULE_test.j`** white-box test-overlay convention (pairs with M16.8
  `jennifer test`).

**Decisions.** **Private by default** (stance 2): the public API is the
`export`-ed set, greppable in one pass, and a forgotten marker stays
internal (the fail-safe direction) - no `public` / `private` keyword.
**Accessing a private name** from outside errors positioned at the call
site (`foo.helper: 'helper' is not exported from module 'foo'`); no
field-level visibility - an exported struct exports its whole shape.
**Library types cross the boundary freely**: the referential-closure check
concerns only *module* structs, so a library type in an exported
signature - a system-library struct (`net.Conn`, `time.Time`) or an opaque
object (`json.Value`, a `KindObject`) - is always visible and
value-semantic, and an exported `func` may take or return one with no
restriction. **Scripts vs modules by entry, not content**: `export` in a
`jennifer run` script is a parse error ("script has no importers"); a
module with zero exports loads fine and yields an empty namespace (any
`NAME.x` errors as undefined) - promoting a script to a module is the
deliberate "I now have a public API" moment. **Test overlays**: a
co-located `MODULE_test.j` is spliced into `MODULE.j`'s scope *before*
`parser.Resolve` runs over the combined file, so slot numbering covers
both and the overlay reads private names by bare identifier (black-box
tests use `import "./MODULE.j";` instead); one overlay per module. Splicing
after resolution would strand the overlay at `(-1, -1)` and force
name-based fallback, so it folds in pre-resolve.

**Acceptance.** An unmarked helper is unreachable as `mod.helper` (with the
positioned error) while an `export`-ed name resolves; an exported struct
with a private-struct field errors at annotation; `export` in a run script
is a parse error; a zero-export module imports but every `NAME.x` errors;
a `MODULE_test.j` overlay reads `MODULE.j`'s private names and runs under
`jennifer test`.

### M17.5 - `ansi` (first reference module)

The first module built on the system - small, useful, pure Jennifer, and a
real dogfood of `import` / `export` / resolution end to end. Terminal
styling as explicit string wrappers; escape-code generation is pure string
work, so no Go is needed.

- **Surface.** `ansi.color(s, name)` / `ansi.bgColor(s, name)`,
  `ansi.style(s, name)` (bold / dim / italic / underline / reverse),
  `ansi.rgb(s, r, g, b)` for truecolor, `ansi.strip(s)` to remove all
  escapes, plus convenience shortcuts `ansi.red(s)` / `ansi.bold(s)` /
  ... `export`ed from `modules/ansi.j`.
- **TTY-aware and stateless.** Gates styling on `os.isTerminal("stdout")`
  ([M16.13](#m1613---osisterminal)) so redirected output stays clean,
  overridable by the `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` environment convention
  (read per call via `os.getEnv`) - a standard cross-tool signal, and
  stateless, so the module honours M17.3's no-mutable-state rule (there is
  no `enabled(flag)` toggle to store). Degrades to always-on if
  `os.isTerminal` is absent.
- **Why it is the reference module.** It exercises the whole module path -
  a real `import`, `export`ed names, one system dependency (`use os;`)
  across the boundary - with code small enough to read in one sitting; a
  better M17 proof than a toy.
- **Not a `printf` modifier.** Colour is a string wrapper, not I/O and not
  value formatting, so a `%s|color=` printf modifier is rejected in its
  favour ([rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)).

**Acceptance.** `import`s and resolves as a module; wrapping composes and
nests; `strip` reverses it; styling suppresses when `os.isTerminal` is
false and when `NO_COLOR` is set, and is forced on by `FORCE_COLOR`; the
module holds no mutable top-level state.

### M17.6 - `semver` (module)

The second pure reference module (alongside M17.5 `ansi`): strict
[SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org) parsing, comparison, and increment as a
`.j` module. Like `ansi` it is pure Jennifer with no system dependency, so
it lands on just the module system (no M18 library needed) - and it is the
foundation the future `jvc` package manager
([Long horizon](#long-horizon-recorded-not-scheduled)) needs, since
`install gotify>=1.0.0` is semver comparison at its core.

- **Strict SemVer 2.0.0, not a loose parser.** Exactly
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` plus an optional `-prerelease` and `+build`. The spec
  buys precise precedence - major / minor / patch compared numerically, a
  prerelease sorts *below* its release (`1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0`), and build
  metadata is **ignored** in comparison. A looser N-segment form (e.g.
  `1.2.3.4`) has no defined ordering (`1.2.3` vs `1.2.3.0`?), which would
  quietly break sorting and the package manager's constraint solving, so it
  is rejected as invalid. The interpreter's own `meta.VERSION`
  (`0.16.0-dev+4.a927e1d`) is already valid strict semver, so the module
  parses Jennifer's own version out of the box.
- **Surface.** `export def struct Version { major as int, minor as int,
  patch as int, prerelease as string, build as string };` plus:
  `semver.parse(s) -> Version` (throws on invalid), `semver.isValid(s) ->
  bool`, `semver.toString(v) -> string` (round-trips `parse`);
  `semver.compare(a, b) -> int` (`-1`/`0`/`1`, SemVer precedence) with
  `semver.lt` / `eq` / `gt` wrappers; `semver.isStable(v) -> bool` (no
  prerelease; note `0.y.z` is unstable by convention) and
  `semver.isPrerelease(v) -> bool`; `semver.incMajor` / `incMinor` /
  `incPatch(v) -> Version` (each resets the lower parts and clears
  prerelease + build); `semver.sort(vs) -> list of Version`. `export`ed
  from `modules/semver.j`.
- **`sort` is implemented in the module.** `lists.sort` is scalar-only and
  comparator-based `lists.sortBy` is deferred, so `semver.sort` orders a
  `list of Version` with its own pass over `semver.compare` - a real
  algorithm written in Jennifer, another honest dogfood of the module.
- **Stateless, declarations-only.** `Version` is a value-semantic struct
  the caller holds and passes; nothing is stored, so M17.3's no-mutable-
  state rule holds.
- **Range matching deferred.** Constraint grammar
  (`satisfies(v, "^1.2.0"` / `">=1.0.0"` / `"~1.2.3")`) is out of scope
  here; it is the harder parser and lands with (or just before) `jvc`.
  M17.6 ships the version *values* and their ordering.

**Acceptance.** `import "semver.j" as semver;` resolves and exports
`Version` + the functions; `parse` of a full `X.Y.Z-pre+build` round-trips
through `toString`; an invalid string (four segments, empty part, bad
prerelease) is rejected; `compare` orders `1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0 < 1.0.1 <
1.1.0 < 2.0.0` and ignores build metadata; `isStable` / `isPrerelease`
agree with the presence of a prerelease tag; the `inc*` helpers reset lower
parts and drop prerelease / build; `sort` orders a shuffled list; and
`semver.parse(meta.VERSION)` succeeds.

## M18.x - Jennifer-coded modules

Built atop the existing system libraries. Each one ships as a Jennifer
**module** under `modules/` (the directory introduced in M17); none of
them are compiled into the interpreter binary. Sub-milestones in priority
order.

### M18.1 - `csv`

Simple, useful early.

### M18.2 - `markdown`

A lightweight `.j` renderer: Markdown to HTML, and to ANSI for terminal
output (reusing the `ansi` module from M17.5). Line-oriented text
orchestration - the shape a `.j` module does well - starting with a small
CommonMark subset (headings, emphasis, links, lists, code spans / blocks)
rather than the full spec. Documents are small, so per-line interpreter
overhead is a non-issue.

### M18.3 - `mail`

SMTP / IMAP / POP3 clients plus MIME (RFC 5322 headers, multipart, 7bit /
8bit / quoted-printable / base64 transfer encodings). **Pure Jennifer**:
the protocols are line-oriented command/response state machines and MIME
is header + boundary structure - exactly the text orchestration a `.j`
module does well - with the heavy lifting delegated to system libraries.
Two system prerequisites, because neither can be pure Jennifer:

- **net TLS ([M16.14](#m1614---net-tls), system).** Mail is almost always
  encrypted (implicit TLS on 465 / 993 / 995, STARTTLS on 587 / 143 /
  110), and TLS is cryptographic - it must be the host's
  (`net.connectTLS` / `net.startTLS`), never interpreted `.j`.
- **quoted-printable in `encoding`
  ([M16.15](#m1615---encoding-completion), system).** The MIME transfer
  codec, alongside the base64 the module also leans on.

With those in place the `mail` module stays pure Jennifer: connection
dialogue, header parse/build, MIME-tree assembly and walk, and address /
date formatting.

- **SASL auth, ordering-aware.** SMTP AUTH / IMAP / POP3 login is SASL,
  which is pure message orchestration (a good `.j` fit, not a crypto
  primitive). The crypto-free mechanisms - `PLAIN`, `LOGIN`, `XOAUTH2`
  (base64 only, already in `encoding`) - ship here and cover most
  real-world mail. The challenge-response mechanisms (`SCRAM-SHA-256`,
  `CRAM-MD5`) need HMAC / PBKDF2 from **M20.1 `crypto`**, so they land with
  / after M20.1, factored into a small shared `sasl` `.j` module a later
  LDAP client (M24+) reuses. SASL / SCRAM is a *consumer* of crypto
  primitives, never part of M20.1 itself.

### M18.4 - `redis`

A Redis client over `net`. RESP2 framing (`+OK`, `$len`, `*count`,
`:int`, `-ERR`) parses cleanly in `.j`; commands go out as RESP arrays.
Plaintext first (trusted network / localhost); `rediss://` TLS is a later
add via net TLS ([M16.14](#m1614---net-tls)). `AUTH [user] password` is a
plain command, so no `crypto` dependency. Typed per-command helpers
(`get -> string`, `incr -> int`, `lrange -> list`) keep the common path
fully typed; a generic `command(...)` returning the raw reply would use
an opaque `redis.Reply` walked with accessors, the same pattern as
`json.Value` ([M16.16](#m1616---jsonvalue)). No hard prerequisites (just
`net`), so it can land ahead of `mail`.

### M18.5 - `memcache`

A client for the `memcached` server's text protocol (`set` / `get` /
`delete` / `incr` / `decr`; replies `STORED` / `VALUE ... END`) over
`net`. Pure Jennifer, plaintext (memcached rarely uses TLS); values are
`bytes` / `string`. Named `memcache` for the client / protocol; it talks
to a `memcached` daemon.

### M18.6 - `http` (client)

A client over `net`. HTTPS needs net TLS ([M16.14](#m1614---net-tls)).
Groups with the `httpd` server below; the two can share HTTP request /
response parsing.

### M18.6.1 - `gotify` (reference module)

A tiny real-world module built on the M18.6 `http` client: push a
notification to a [Gotify](https://gotify.net) server. It is the second
reference module (after M17.5 `ansi`), and the first that crosses the
module boundary into a *network* dependency - small enough to read in one
sitting, and the headline example that makes the http client tangible.

- **Surface.** `export def struct Config { url as string, token as string };`
  plus `export func push(cfg as Config, title as string, message as string,
  priority as int)`. `push` POSTs `title` / `message` / `priority` as
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `cfg.url + "/message"` with an
  `X-Gotify-Key: cfg.token` header - Gotify's
  [push-message](https://gotify.net/docs/pushmsg) contract, where
  [priority](https://gotify.net/docs/priority) is a plain int. Returns the
  `http` response so the caller can check the status.
- **Stateless, declarations-only.** No `init()` that stashes url + token:
  M17.3 forbids mutable module state. The caller holds a value-semantic
  `Config` and passes it per call, the same shape as the `time` / `hash`
  structs. Usage: `def g as gotify.Config init gotify.Config{ url: $url,
  token: $tok }; gotify.push($g, "Title", "Body", 5);`.
- **Built on `http.post`, not hand-rolled.** The module is ~15 lines
  because M18.6 owns the HTTP framing, TLS (HTTPS via M16.14), and form
  encoding; a version predating the http client would hand-roll HTTP/1.1
  over `net.connectTLS` and be thrown away when M18.6 landed, so it is
  deliberately sequenced after it. Ships as `modules/gotify.j`, resolved
  through the module search path like any other module.

**Acceptance.** `import "gotify.j" as gotify;` resolves and exports
`Config` + `push`; a `push` to a running Gotify server returns a 2xx and
the message appears in the server's feed; a bad token surfaces the server's
4xx as a value, not a crash. The URL and token are supplied by the caller
and never committed - the example reads them from the environment and the
docs use placeholders.

### M18.6.2 - `rest` (module)

The ergonomic REST layer over the M18.6 `http` client - a genuine
library-sized `.j` module (a step up from `gotify`'s one endpoint), and the
proof that the module system carries a real utility written in the language
itself. It is a **module, not a system library**, because it needs no host
capability of its own: everything hard is already owned by `http` (verbs,
headers, TLS, body framing) and `json` ([M16.9](#m169---json)); `rest` is
pure composition over the two, so putting it in Go would duplicate `http`
and break the dependency-free / TinyGo-clean stances for no gain. The split
is deliberate: `http` is the transport primitive (Go, needs `net` / TLS),
`rest` is the convenience layer (`.j`).

- **Surface.** A value-semantic client plus JSON-aware verbs:
  `export def struct Client { baseUrl as string, headers as map of string
  to string };` and `export func get/post/put/patch/delete(c as Client,
  path as string, ...)` returning a `Response` struct
  `{ status as int, headers as map of string to string, body as string }`.
  JSON convenience wrappers - `rest.getJson(c, path) -> json.Value`,
  `rest.postJson(c, path, body as json.Value)` - encode / decode through
  `json` and set `Content-Type`. Base-URL joining, query-string building,
  and `Authorization` (Bearer / Basic, the latter via `encoding` base64)
  are string / map work.
- **Stateless, declarations-only.** Like `gotify`, the caller holds the
  `Client` value and threads it per call (M17.3 forbids mutable module
  state); auth lives in `Client.headers`. A stateful cookie-jar *session*
  is deliberately out of scope for v1 - it would need either a
  functionally-threaded jar or an `http`-side handle (a system library may
  hold stateful handles like `net.Conn`; a module may not), so it is
  deferred to `http` rather than dragging `rest` into Go.
- **Built on `http` + `json`, not hand-rolled.** No sockets, no TLS, no
  parsing in this module - it calls `http` for transport and `json` for
  bodies. Ships as `modules/rest.j`, resolved through the module search
  path.

**Acceptance.** `import "rest.j" as rest;` resolves and exports `Client` +
the verb functions; a full CRUD round-trip against a test server
(`postJson` create -> `getJson` read -> `put`/`patch` update -> `delete`)
returns the expected statuses and decoded bodies; a 4xx / 5xx is reported
as a `Response` value (status inspectable), not a crash; base-URL joining
and query params compose without double slashes.

### M18.7 - `httpd` (server)

A pure-Jennifer HTTP server atop `net`, shipped as a module (same shape
as the other M18 modules), not baked into the interpreter - the point
where Jennifer becomes useful for serving content. Per-connection
handlers run in `spawn` blocks (depends on **M16.0** concurrency) over the
`net` TCP listener (**M16.2**); it can share HTTP request / response
parsing with the M18.6 client. (Formerly the standalone M20.)

### M18.8 - `toml`

A `.j` module: TOML's regular, line / section-oriented grammar
(`[table]`, `key = value`) maps cleanly to `map` / `list` / `time.Time` -
the `.j`-friendliest of the config formats (unlike `yaml` / `xml`, which
go to M20 as system libraries). Covers the grammar corners: multiline
strings, inline tables, arrays of tables. (`.ini` is a deferred tiny
cousin only if demand surfaces - no real standard, ambiguous quoting /
typing.)

## M19 - reserved

A reserved slot.
M19 is kept as a placeholder for a future milestone.

## M20 - system libraries

Go **system libraries**: cryptographic primitives, plus formats too heavy
or too reflect-bound for a Jennifer-coded `.j` module (the `json` pattern,
[M16.9](#m169---json)). Members below; more land as M20.x as needs arise.

### M20.1 - `crypto`

Symmetric and asymmetric primitives, key derivation, crypto-grade random.
System library; TinyGo-safe primitives only. Hashes already shipped in
M15.6.

- **Swap `uuid`'s random source.** `uuid` (M16.10) draws its v4 / v7
  randomness from `math`'s shared non-crypto RNG (seedable, predictable -
  documented). When crypto-grade random lands here, repoint
  `uuidlib.randByte` at it so `uuid.v4` is unguessable; the change is one
  function, no surface change. Until then `uuid` must not be used for
  security tokens.
- **Message authentication (HMAC).** `crypto.hmac(key, data, algo) ->
  bytes` over the `hash` algorithms, plus a constant-time
  `crypto.hmacEqual` for verification. Go standard library
  (`crypto/hmac`), no dependency, TinyGo-clean - and the shared
  foundation the KDFs below build on (PBKDF2 is iterated HMAC; HKDF and
  SASL SCRAM are HMAC-based). Needed directly all the time too: request
  signing, webhook verification, JWT HS256, TOTP.
- **Key derivation (stdlib, no dependency).** `HKDF` - derive keys from a
  high-entropy secret - and `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256` - derive a key from a
  password (salt + iteration count). Both come from the Go standard
  library (`crypto/hkdf`, `crypto/pbkdf2`, stdlib since Go 1.24), so they
  add no dependency and stay TinyGo-clean. Shape: `crypto.hkdf(...)` /
  `crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keyLen) -> bytes`.
- **Password hashing is out of scope here.** Argon2id (and bcrypt /
  scrypt) moved to the Long-horizon list: they need the `x/crypto`
  dependency and their own `hashPassword` / `verifyPassword` surface.

### M20.2 - `xml`

Hand-rolled like `json` (Go's `encoding/xml` is reflect-heavy, so
TinyGo-hostile). A genuinely complex tree - attributes + ordered,
possibly-duplicated children + mixed text + namespaces + entities - whose
byte-level parsing is too slow in `.j`. Also the natural mirror target for
the `json.Value` read / write vocabulary
([M16.16](#m1616---jsonvalue)): the same opaque-handle plus path-addressed
accessor shape (an XPath-style path dialect in place of JSON Pointer).

### M20.3 - `yaml`

A system library because full YAML - anchors / aliases, flow *and* block
styles, implicit typing, multi-document streams - is impractical in `.j`
and has no Go stdlib. Unlike `xml`, that means a **Go dependency** (e.g.
`gopkg.in/yaml.v3`): the one place a config parser earns one, since a
hand-rolled full YAML is a project of its own. Verify TinyGo-cleanliness
of the dependency, and fall back to a documented subset if it won't build
there.

---

**Phase E: embedding, WASM, and specialised domains (M21+).** Not
committed to a timeline; recorded so the design doesn't foreclose
them. Ordered by the size of the structural change each one is:
M21's `internal/` -> `pkg/` restructure is a single-repo refactor;
M22's WASM runtime brings in a whole new dependency; M23.x/M24+
are indefinite-in-count library families.

## M21 - Public interpreter API for third-party embedding

Extract the interpreter core out from under `internal/` and
expose a documented Go-side surface so external programs can
embed Jennifer. Today `internal/interpreter`,
`internal/parser`, `internal/lexer`, and `internal/lib/*` are
unreachable from any module that isn't `github.com/mplx/jennifer-lang`
- Go's `internal/` visibility rule is not a convention, it's
a compile-time barrier. No submodule / require / replace
workaround exists; embedding is impossible without a
restructure.

Ships ahead of M22's WASM runtime because a Go-side embedding
API is a strictly smaller change (repository restructure, no
new external dependency), it unblocks the most immediate
embedding scenarios (scripting slot in a Go host, LSP /
formatter tooling, test harnesses), and it does not foreclose
M22 - a WASM plugin surface can layer on the same `pkg/`
facade once Wazero (or similar) is in play.

**Concretely.** Add a `pkg/` top-level (working name; the
final path settles at start of M21):

- `pkg/interpreter` re-exports `Interpreter`, `Value`, error
  types, and the `Install(in *Interpreter)` registration API
  that every stdlib library already uses. The `internal/`
  packages stay as the implementation; `pkg/` is the stable
  facade with semver-covered surface once we ship 1.0.
- `pkg/lib/*` re-exports each shipped library (`convert`,
  `math`, `strings`, ...) so a host can install the ones it
  wants and leave out the rest. Non-breaking for the current
  CLI - `cmd/jennifer` picks up the same `Install` calls,
  just through `pkg/lib` shims instead of directly.
- Documented pluggable interfaces for the host-provided
  facilities the OS-touching libraries currently reach for:
  - `io.Writer` for `io.printf` output (already a
    `*Interpreter` field; formalize as an interface).
  - `io.Reader` for `io.readLine` / `io.readBytes` /
    `io.readChars` stdin.
  - `Clock` for `time.now()` / `time.local()` / `time.sleep`
    (the `nowFunc` / `sleepFunc` test hooks in
    `internal/lib/time` are the shape).
  - `Rand` for `math.rand*` / `lists.shuffle` (the shared
    random source).
  - Filesystem / network / process hooks left as future
    work - a host wanting those either installs the
    stdlib libraries as-is (accepting the Go `os` /
    `net` dependencies) or ships its own shims. A
    documented registration pattern is the deliverable;
    the shims themselves are per-host and out of scope
    for M21.

**Stdlib-backed defaults.** Each pluggable interface
carries a working default so `pkg/interpreter.New()`
plus `pkg/lib/io.Install(in)` produces a running
interpreter without every embedder wiring up seven
interfaces first. `Clock` defaults to Go's `time.Now`,
`Rand` to a `math/rand` source, `io.Writer` to
`os.Stdout`, `io.Reader` to `os.Stdin`. Hosts override
only what they need. A `no-os` embedder replaces every
default; a Slack-bot embedder swaps just `io.Writer`
for its outgoing-message pipe and leaves the rest.

**Boundary rules at the Install site.** Three explicit
error paths so hosts get loud, positioned failures
instead of subtle misbehaviour:

- **Duplicate library `Install` at the Go level is
  rejected**, mirroring how a duplicate `use NAME;`
  errors at the Jennifer level (M10 rule, lifted). A
  host installing `pkg/lib/math` and then its own
  shim that also claims the `math` namespace fails at
  the second `Install` call, not silently overlaid.
- **`Install` and pluggable-interface setters are
  frozen once `Run()` starts.** Attempts to call
  `Install`, `SetClock`, `SetOut`, or friends after
  the interpreter has begun executing produce a
  positioned "cannot configure interpreter mid-run"
  error at the Go call site. The interpreter can then
  trust its host bindings for the rest of the run
  without defensive re-checks.
- **Host implementations are trusted at the interface
  boundary.** The interpreter uses whatever `Clock.Now()`
  or `Rand.Int63()` returns without validation - a
  broken host implementation is the host's problem, not
  the interpreter's. Stated so hosts don't expect
  defensive checks that aren't there and so downstream
  bug reports are triaged to the correct side of the
  API boundary.

**Non-goals.**
- A hosted no-`os` build target. Even after M21, the
  shipping stdlib libraries lean on Go's `os` / `net` /
  `time` packages. A truly bare-metal or `no-os` embedding
  can only use the pure-value libraries (`convert`, `math`,
  `strings`, `lists`, `maps`, `hash`, `crc`, `encoding`,
  `regex`) plus whatever host-provided shims the embedder
  wires up. That's a design constraint on the embedder, not
  a milestone on Jennifer's side.
- Semver freezing the public API. Jennifer stays pre-1.0
  through M21; the milestone documents what's exported and
  how libraries plug in, but breaking changes to that
  surface remain allowed until 1.0.0.

**Motivation.** Third-party embedding has multiple concrete
consumers already imagined: scripting-language slot in a Go
application, tooling that needs direct AST / interpreter
access (LSP, formatter integrations, syntax highlighters),
test harnesses that want to drive `.j` programs from Go,
config-DSL runtimes, plugin systems for game engines and
similar. None of them require an OS-free build; all of them
need the `internal/` -> `pkg/` restructure.

The `Install` pattern already works this way - every stdlib
library is a `pkg.Install(in)` call. The missing piece is
visibility, plus documented hooks for the pieces of host
state currently exposed only as package-level test vars.

## M22 - WASM runtime embedding

Wazero or similar inside the interpreter binary. TinyGo-size
cost evaluated honestly before commitment. Without M22, no WASM
libraries.

## M23.x - WASM libraries

If M22 ships, sandboxed plugins via `use wasm:libname;`. Each
library a sub-milestone.

## M24+ - Specialised domains

Each domain its own milestone with sub-milestones as needed:

- **ML.**
  - **M24.1 - `stats`** - descriptive statistics over
    `list of int|float`: mean, median, mode, variance, stddev,
    percentile, min / max / sum, correlation. Pure-value,
    TinyGo-clean; the highest-value, simplest piece, so first.
  - **M24.2 - `linalg`** - vectors as `list of float` (dot, norm,
    cross, scale, add / sub) and matrices as `list of list of float`
    (matmul, transpose, determinant, inverse, solve, identity).
    Algorithms implemented directly - no `gonum`, too large a
    dependency. Matrices stay `list of list of float` for v1
    (idiomatic and value-semantic); a Go-backed matrix handle is the
    noted future escape hatch when big-matrix performance demands it.
  - **M24.3 - ML primitives** - atop `stats` / `linalg`, when demand
    surfaces.
- **Bioinformatics.** Sequence alignment (Smith-Waterman,
  Needleman-Wunsch), FASTA/FASTQ parsers, molecule structures.
- **Encoding / binary protocols.**
  - **`asn1`** - ASN.1 BER/DER encode/decode, as a **Go system
    library**. Byte-level binary parsing belongs in Go, not `.j` (the
    `json` lesson: a char-by-char parser in the interpreter pays
    overhead per byte). This is the *enabler* for a family of binary
    protocols and PKI formats - LDAP, SNMP, X.509, PKCS. Go's stdlib
    `encoding/asn1` is DER-only, so the full BER that LDAP / SNMP use
    (indefinite lengths, alternative encodings) needs either a BER
    dependency (e.g. `go-asn1-ber`) or a hand-rolled BER codec in Go.
  - **`ldap` / `snmp` (layered on `asn1` + `net`).** With `asn1` doing
    the byte crunching in Go and `net` providing TCP/UDP + TLS
    (`connectTLS` / `startTLS` already cover LDAPS / StartTLS), the
    protocol orchestration (bind, build request, iterate results) is
    not per-byte hot and can live in a `.j` module or a thin Go library.
    SNMP is the natural first client (simpler PDUs, UDP, no SASL); LDAP
    adds controls + SASL (SCRAM builds on M20.1 `crypto`). A pure-`.j`
    implementation of the BER layer itself is explicitly *not* the plan.
    Existing pure implementations (e.g. PHP FreeDSx) are a protocol
    reference, not a port target - their heavy OO shape does not map to
    Jennifer's value-semantic structs.
- **Sandbox.** Restricted-capability execution.

Ordered when demand surfaces. WASM libraries (M23.x) may cover
some of this space first.

## Path to 1.0.0 distribution (parallel track)

The core CI + release + packaging items that used to live here
were promoted into M15.8 (the last step before Phase C). What
stays on this parallel track is the post-M15.8 polish - items
that can land any time and don't block any milestone:

- **Homebrew tap** for macOS users.
- **Snap** package.
- **Nix flake** / Nix package.
- **Cross-build for macOS / Windows.** Waits on the
  platform-portability work in the Long-horizon list; ships as
  soon as that lands.
- **Real apt repository** (replacing the "GitHub Release
  artifact" install of the M15.8 `.deb`) if user demand
  warrants the maintenance.
- **Snap / Flatpak**, **AppImage**, or any other Linux
  distribution format Jennifer users actually ask for.

Each of these ships when there's user demand and a maintainer
willing to keep it green; they're not blocking anything.

---

## Long horizon (recorded, not scheduled)

- **Cross-platform support.** Today Jennifer targets Linux only.
  Windows and macOS are planned. When touching filesystem, paths,
  line endings, or process behavior, prefer portable stdlib
  helpers (`path/filepath`, not hardcoded `/`); avoid Linux-only
  assumptions.
- **`time`: IANA / DST zones.** Real zone names (`Europe/Berlin`) with
  historically-correct daylight-saving resolution, added to the `time`
  **system library** - not a hand-maintained `.j` data map. A `.j` map is
  the wrong shape: abbreviations (`CST` is US Central *and* China Standard
  *and* Cuba Standard) don't identify a zone, and the real model is
  offset-per-(zone, instant) over a transition history that ships several
  updates a year. Back it with Go's `time.LoadLocation` + the embeddable
  `time/tzdata` (or the host's `/usr/share/zoneinfo`), so the database is
  the toolchain's problem and resolution is correct at any instant.
  Standard-`jennifer` only: TinyGo's `time` can't load zones, so
  `jennifer-tiny` stays fixed-offset (a build-tag split like `net`).
  Level 1 first - an offset-at-instant resolver
  (`time.offsetAt(name, $t)` / `time.zoneFor(name, $t) -> time.Zone`) that
  leaves the `time.Time {nanos, offset}` model untouched (the snapshot is
  fixed, so DST-crossing arithmetic must re-resolve); Level 2 - a
  zone-carrying `time.Time` with DST-correct arithmetic - is a larger,
  optional follow-up needing a Go-backed zone handle.
- **Password hashing (Argon2id / bcrypt / scrypt).** The modern default
  for password *storage*, deferred out of M20.1 `crypto` because it lives in
  `golang.org/x/crypto` (a dependency, unlike the stdlib KDFs M20.1 ships)
  and wants its own surface distinct from the KDFs: a self-describing
  `crypto.hashPassword(pw) -> string` (`$argon2id$...`) plus a
  constant-time `crypto.verifyPassword(pw, hash) -> bool`. Added when
  password storage is a concrete need, taking the `x/crypto` dependency
  then - crypto is the one place the dependency-free stance bends, since
  you never hand-roll it.
- **`encoding` - the harder codecs.** The single-byte character codecs and
  binary-to-text formats all shipped (M16.15); the deferred remainder,
  picked up only when a real program needs one: variable-width Asian
  encodings (`Shift-JIS`, `Big5`, `GB2312`, `GBK`, `GB18030`, `EUC-JP`,
  `EUC-KR`) - each a state machine with variant / ambiguity edge cases, a
  whole milestone apiece; `UTF-16` / `UTF-16LE` / `UTF-16BE` / `UTF-32` (BOM,
  surrogate pairs, endianness); and `UTF-7` (mail-transport - though
  `quoted-printable` already shipped as a general codec).
- **Module package manager + registry (`jvc`).** A CLI package tool plus a
  public registry (packagist-style) so a developer can declare and install
  third-party `.j` modules: `jvc install gotify>=1.0.0` resolves a version
  constraint against the registry and downloads into a project-local
  `./vendor` directory, which becomes one more module search root - the M17
  resolver already walks a search path (system dir, then `-I` dirs), so
  `vendor/` is an added entry, not a new resolution model. Needs a manifest
  + lockfile format, semver constraint solving, a registry service and
  publish flow, and integrity pinning (content hash per version). A whole
  track of its own; the module system (M17) is the prerequisite,
  `semver` ([M17.6](#m176---semver-module)) supplies the version
  comparison and constraint core it resolves against, and `gotify`
  ([M18.6.1](#m1861---gotify-reference-module)) is the first module worth
  publishing through it.
- **FCGI.** `use FCGI as web;` library when `net` and `httpd`
  mature. Lets Jennifer host CGI / FastCGI workloads end-to-end.
- **Inline assembler.**
- **Binary AST cache (`.jc` files).** Pre-parsed loading for big
  programs and embedded scripting hosts. Its own milestone when
  it lands - file-format design, versioning, and TinyGo-safe
  serialization are enough work to merit dedicated treatment. The
  text JSON form via `jennifer ast` is the placeholder until then.
  Deferred from M5.
- **Profiler: max-call-depth metric.** Have `jennifer profile` track
  Jennifer call depth (bump in `evalCall`, drop on return) and report
  the max reached, per source position and overall. Names stack-limit
  problems directly - the recursion-depth-vs-`-stack-size` headroom
  that the recursive `fib` in `examples/benchmark.j` exercises on
  `jennifer-tiny`. Small and additive to the existing hit-count /
  wall-clock / `--allocs` collector; deferred because stack limits are
  diagnosable by hand today. Heap-per-position stays out of scope
  (`--allocs` already proxies copy churn; true RSS needs
  `runtime.ReadMemStats` sampling, coarse under TinyGo).
- **`tinygo_devtools` build tag.** The dev subcommands (`tokens` /
  `ast` / `fmt` / `lint` / `profile` / `test`) are `!tinygo` for binary
  *size*, not compatibility - they are TinyGo-clean Go. A
  `//go:build !tinygo || tinygo_devtools` constraint (stub as
  `tinygo && !tinygo_devtools`) plus a `make build-tinygo-dev` target
  would let them run under the actual TinyGo runtime - e.g. to
  `profile` a TinyGo-specific perf or stack issue in situ. Pairs with
  the depth metric above: together they are "TinyGo runtime
  introspection." Deferred - build-tag complexity across ~6 files and a
  larger dev-tiny binary, for a diagnostic reached for only
  occasionally.
- **Build-time library selection.** Choose which system (Go) libraries
  are baked into a binary at compile time. Motivated by `jennifer-tiny`
  size (an embedded target needing only `io` + `math` shouldn't carry
  `net` / `regex` / `hash`) and by opt-in niche Go libraries that don't
  merit defaulting. The install point is already consolidated - every
  entry path (`run` / `repl` / `profile` / `test` and the test
  harnesses) calls `internal/stdlib.InstallAll`, so a library is one
  line there - and that is the seam a build-tag scheme would cut along:
  gate each entry behind `//go:build lib_net` (or a `minimal` / `full`
  profile) and grow `make build-minimal` / `make build TAGS=...`,
  exactly like the existing `!tinygo` dev-tool split. **Compile-time
  only** - Go's `plugin` package is Linux/macOS-only and unsupported by
  TinyGo, and dynamic linking contradicts `jennifer-tiny`'s
  no-hosted-runtime goal, so PHP-style loadable `.so` extensions are
  out. Two caveats to design for: (1) a trimmed build breaks the "any
  `.j` runs on any binary" portability promise (`use net;` becomes a
  runtime error), so the default build stays full and trimmed builds are
  an explicit opt-out - ideally with a `meta`-level "is library X
  present?" query for graceful degradation; (2) CI grows a couple of
  profiles (default / minimal), not 2^N. Complementary to, not a
  substitute for, the M17 module system: `.j`-level extensibility
  (community / uncommon libraries writable in Jennifer) is M17's job with
  zero binary cost; build-time selection is only for the curated Go-level core.
- **Relational databases (`sql`).** Postponed to M20+, pending a design
  discussion. A system library - a storage engine and SQL planner can't
  be interpreted, and wire-protocol auth needs crypto - driver-agnostic
  over Go's `database/sql`, SQLite first, then MySQL / PostgreSQL;
  standard-Go only, stubbed on `jennifer-tiny`. The questions that gate
  it: the SQLite driver (cgo `mattn/go-sqlite3`, which breaks static /
  cross-compile / TinyGo, vs pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite`, multi-MB);
  whether to accept the first heavyweight dependency in the library
  layer (a break from "libraries stay dependency-free") and, if so, gate
  it as a build-tag opt-in (per the note above); and the result-row
  shape - an opaque `sql.Row` accessor type mirroring `json.Value`
  (M16.16) vs a typed struct via the deferred map-to-struct conversion.
  Values bind only
  through `?` placeholders (injection safety). Contrast the
  text-protocol stores redis / memcache (M18.4 / M18.5), which are pure
  Jennifer over `net` and need none of this.
- **Explicit map-to-struct conversion.** A spelled-out, validating way to
  turn a `json.Value` object (or a homogeneous `map of string to T`) into
  a typed struct - the sanctioned counterpart to the *rejected* implicit
  coercion (see [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md)). Deferred
  from the M16.x line: once JSON is destructured through `json.Value`
  accessors, the by-hand rebuild covers the need, so a one-call form is a
  convenience, not a blocker. Two candidate shapes, decided on consistency
  not brevity - a `convert.toStruct($map, "Point")` library call (a
  two-arg, stringly-typed outlier in the otherwise one-arg `convert.toX`
  family, or else not self-contained if it reads the binding's declared
  type) versus a `Point{ ..$map }` struct-literal spread (names its type
  statically, at the cost of new literal syntax). Either way strict: every
  declared field present with a matching type, recursing into nested
  structs / lists / maps, value-semantic, no partial fills or defaults.
- **`io.lines() -> list of string`.** Slurp the whole stdin into a
  list. Additive on top of the streaming `readLine()` + `eof()`
  idiom; nice-to-have for tiny scripts, not blocking. Deferred from
  M7.
- **i18n.** Locale-aware case folding, collation, number / date
  formatting, BiDi. Gated on the CLDR-data binary-size question
  (likely an optional library shipped after the M22 WASM runtime
  so locale tables aren't baked into every build).
- **Host-embedding API.** *Promoted to a numbered milestone -
  see [M21](#m21---public-interpreter-api-for-third-party-embedding).*
- **Advanced scheduling knobs.** CPU affinity, work-stealing
  pool sizing, NUMA awareness, `GOMAXPROCS`-equivalent runtime
  tuning. Runtime-config surface for the M16.0 spawn scheduler,
  not new language features. Ships when a real use case forces
  it (the M16.0 default - "let Go's scheduler decide" -
  handles every workload we've imagined so far).
- **Performance & memory.** Interpreter-internal optimizations
  that preserve stance #5 (value semantics) at the user level:
  copy-on-write for lists / maps / bytes / structs (share
  underlying storage until a write splits it), per-frame arena
  allocation, and read-only slice views (`xs[1..5]` as a
  non-owning window that errors on assignment). Strictly
  optimizations - no user-visible aliasing or mutation rules
  change. Stance-breaking variants (mutable references,
  interior mutability, shared mutable state) are turned down in
  [technical/rejected.md](technical/rejected.md#references-interior-mutability-shared-mutable-state).
  Best landed post-M22 once the language is settled and the
  interpreter doesn't churn under it.
