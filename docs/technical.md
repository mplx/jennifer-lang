## Lexer (`internal/lexer`)

A hand-written, single-pass scanner.

### Token types

```

                       FOR
                       TRUE
                       FALSE
                       NULL
                       AND
                       OR
                       NOT
                       DIV
                       INT_TYPE
                       FLOAT_TYPE
                       STRING_TYPE
                       BOOL_TYPE
```

`def` introduces a variable or constant binding (TOKEN_DEFINE); `func`
introduces a method (TOKEN_FUNC). `import` (TOKEN_IMPORT) is for **file
imports** (`import "path.j";`); `use` (TOKEN_USE) is for **library imports**
(`use io;`). `DOT` (`.`) no longer appears in import syntax (paths are
strings now) and is reserved for future expression use.
Comparison tokens `LE`, `GE`, `EQ` are two-character (`<=`, `>=`, `==`) and
are recognized by a one-character lookahead from `<`, `>`, `=`. `RETURN` is
already reserved for M3.

`VARREF` carries the variable name *without* the leading `$`.
`STRING` carries the value *with* escape sequences already processed and *without*
surrounding quotes.

### Position tracking

Every token records `Line` and `Col` (both 1-based) and `File` (the absolute
path supplied to `TokenizeWithFile`, or `""` for unattributed input). The
`advance()` helper bumps `line` on `\n` and otherwise bumps `col`. `File`
flows from the token to the AST node (every node embeds `pos{File, Line,
Col}`), so errors raised inside an imported `.j` still point at the
imported file - see "Errors and positions" below.

### Keywords

The lexer's keyword map covers: `def func as init const import use return if
elseif else while for true false null and or not div int float string bool`.
Anything else lexed as a word stays a `TOKEN_IDENT`. `define` is **not** a
keyword and lexes as a plain identifier.

### Comments

`// ...` runs to end of line. `/* ... */` is non-nesting and reports an
"unterminated block comment" error if unclosed.

### Identifier rule

Per the spec, names use `[A-Za-z]` only. Digits and underscores are explicitly
**not** part of identifiers; encountering one mid-token ends the identifier.

## Grammar (M3) - EBNF

The authoritative grammar for what the parser accepts. This grammar describes
the token stream **after** preprocessing - file imports (`import STRING ;`)
are spliced before the parser runs, so they don't appear here. Only library
imports (`use IDENT ;`) reach the parser.

Terminals in CAPITALS are token classes from the lexer (see [Token types](#token-types));
quoted strings are keywords or punctuation that match the corresponding token's
lexeme.

```ebnf
program     = { useStmt | methodDef | statement } EOF ;
useStmt     = "use" IDENT ";" ;                     (* library import *)
methodDef   = "func" IDENT "(" [ paramList ] ")" block ;

```

**Semantic notes that aren't expressed in the grammar:**

- Two separate keywords: `def` introduces a binding (variable or constant);
  `func` introduces a method. There's no longer any lookahead disambiguation
  in this area - the parser dispatches purely on the keyword.
- The name in `defineStmt` is a bare `IDENT`. Writing `def $x as int`
  produces a parse error with a hint to drop the `$` (it's reserved for
  use-site references).
- Operator precedence (lowest to highest): `or`, `and`, unary `not`,
  comparison `< > <= >= ==`, additive `+ -`, multiplicative `* / %`, unary
  `-`. Binary operators are left-associative; `not` and unary `-` are
  right-associative (`not not x` and `--x` are both valid).
- `and` and `or` **short-circuit**: the right operand is not evaluated when
  the left already decides the result. Both operands must be `bool`.
- Unary `not` requires `bool`; unary `-` requires `int` or `float`.
- Comparison operators produce `bool`; `if`/`while`/`for` conditions **must**
  be `bool` (no implicit truthiness).
- Mixed `int`/`float` arithmetic promotes `int` to `float`; the result is
  `float`. `%` requires int operands. `+` on two `string` values concatenates.
- **`/` (true division) always returns `float`** (Python 3 semantics). For
  integer-result division use the `div` keyword: `5 / 2 = 2.5`, `5 div 2 = 2`.
  `div` on float operands returns the floor as a float (`5.7 div 2.0 = 2.0`).
- Floats always display with a `.` so the type stays visible: `5.0` prints as
  `"5.0"`, not `"5"`. See `interpreter.DisplayFloat`.
- Methods may only be defined at the top level. Variable definitions, assignments,
  control flow, and expression statements may appear at the top level or inside
  a block.
- Each `block` (`{...}`) introduces a new lexical scope. A binding is visible
  from its `def` to the end of the enclosing block, and is inherited by
  inner blocks; inner scopes **cannot redeclare** a name already visible.
- `for` opens a private scope for its `init`, `cond`, `step`, and body so the
  init variable does not leak out of the loop.
- There is **no required entry point**. Top-level statements execute in source
  order. Methods are hoisted (collected before any top-level statement runs)
  so they can be called regardless of textual order.
- Method bodies inherit the global scope as their outer scope, so top-level
  variables are visible inside methods (subject to the no-shadowing rule).
- Method parameters use bare `IDENT` (no `$`), same as variable definitions.
  Writing `func f($x as int)` errors with "parameter name has no `$`".
- Call sites type-check arguments against the declared parameter types at
  runtime; both arity and per-argument kind are checked.
- Method return values are dynamically typed - methods don't declare a
  return type, and callers receive whatever value the body returns (or
  `null` for a bare `return;` or a body that falls off the end).
- A bare `IDENT` in expression position is parsed as a `CallExpr` if
  immediately followed by `(`, otherwise as a `ConstRefExpr`. At runtime
  the latter must resolve to a constant in scope; a name that resolves to
  a variable produces a helpful error ("use `$name`").

## Parser (`internal/parser`)

Recursive descent with precedence climbing for binary operators. The grammar
the parser implements is the one in [Grammar (M3)](#grammar-m3---ebnf) above.

### AST nodes (M3)

| Node          | Kind  | Fields                                       |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Program`     | root  | `Imports []*ImportStmt`, `Methods []*MethodDef`, `TopLevel []Stmt` |
| `ImportStmt`  | stmt  | `Name`                                       |
| `MethodDef`   | stmt  | `Name`, `Params []Param`, `Body *Block`      |
| `Param`       | -     | `Name`, `Type`                               |
| `Block`       | stmt  | `Stmts []Stmt`                               |
| `DefineStmt`  | stmt  | `IsConst`, `VarName`, `VarType Type`, `InitExpr Expr` (nil = uninit) |
| `AssignStmt`  | stmt  | `VarName`, `Value Expr`                      |
| `ReturnStmt`  | stmt  | `Value Expr` (nil for bare `return;`)        |
| `IfStmt`      | stmt  | `Cond`, `Then *Block`, `ElseIfs []Expr`, `ElseIfBodies []*Block`, `Else *Block` |
| `WhileStmt`   | stmt  | `Cond`, `Body *Block`                        |
| `ForStmt`     | stmt  | `Init Stmt`, `Cond Expr`, `Step Stmt`, `Body *Block` (any may be nil) |
| `ExprStmt`    | stmt  | `Expr`                                       |
| `IntLit`      | expr  | `Value int64`                                |
| `FloatLit`    | expr  | `Value float64`                              |
| `StringLit`   | expr  | `Value string`                               |
| `BoolLit`     | expr  | `Value bool`                                 |
| `NullLit`     | expr  | -                                            |
| `VarExpr`     | expr  | `Name` (no `$`) - mutable-variable reference  |
| `ConstRefExpr`| expr  | `Name` - bare-IDENT reference; interpreter expects it to resolve to a constant |
| `CallExpr`    | expr  | `Callee`, `Args []Expr`                      |
| `BinaryExpr`  | expr  | `Op BinaryOp`, `Left`, `Right` (comparison/logical ops return bool; `and`/`or` short-circuit at eval time) |
| `UnaryExpr`   | expr  | `Op UnaryOp` (`OpNeg`/`OpNot`), `Operand` |

Every node embeds a `pos{File, Line, Col}` for error reporting and exposes it
via `Node.Pos()` (line/col) and `Node.Filename()` (file path). The file is
populated from the originating token so cross-file diagnostics work.

`Sprint(node)` produces a stable textual representation used by tests.

---

## Preprocessor (`internal/preproc`)

Sits between the lexer and the parser. Its only job is to expand file imports
and pass library imports through.

### Algorithm

1. Walk the token stream.
2. When `IMPORT STRING SEMI` is found:
   - Verify the string ends in `.j`.
   - Resolve the path (relative to the current file's directory, or absolute
     if it starts with `/`).
   - Reject if the path was already visited up the import chain (circular import).
   - Read the file, lex it (with file-tagged tokens), recursively preprocess it.
   - Splice the result (dropping the trailing `EOF`) at this point.
3. When `USE IDENT SEMI` is found: pass through unchanged. The parser turns
   it into an `ImportStmt` node.
4. Helpful errors for common mistakes:
   - `import IDENT;` (old library form) -> "use `use NAME;` for system libraries".
   - `import IDENT.j;` (old unquoted file form) -> "file imports take a string literal".
   - `use IDENT.j;` (file form with `use`) -> "use `import \"name.j\";` for files".

### Edge cases

- The path string must literally end in `.j`. `import "foo.go";` is rejected.
- Paths may contain `/` for subdirectories. Absolute paths are accepted as-is;
  relative paths resolve from the importing file's directory.
- Circular imports are detected by tracking absolute paths visited along the
  current chain.

## Interpreter (`internal/interpreter`)

A tree-walking evaluator.

### Runtime values

`Value` is a tagged union (single concrete struct) rather than a Go interface
hierarchy. This avoids `reflect` and method-table indirection, which keeps the
binary small and predictable under TinyGo.

```go
type Value struct {
    Kind  ValueKind  // KindNull | KindInt | KindFloat | KindString | KindBool
    Int   int64
    Float float64
    Str   string
    Bool  bool
}
```

`ZeroFor(t parser.Type)` returns the zero value for each declared type and is
used when a `def` omits its `init` clause: `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `false`, or
`null`. `Value.AsFloat()` handles int->float promotion for arithmetic and
comparison; `Value.Equal()` implements `==` (same-kind comparison, plus the
numeric-promotion rule across `int` and `float`).

### Environment

`Environment` is a parent-linked map of names → `Binding{Value, DeclType, IsConst}`.
Storing the declared type lets `Assign` reject type-mismatching writes (you
cannot assign a string to a variable declared as int).

- **`Define(name, val, declType, isConst)`** - adds to the current frame;
  errors if the name exists *anywhere in the chain* (the spec forbids
  shadowing).
- **`Assign(name, val)`** - walks up the chain to find the binding; errors if
  the binding is a constant, the value's kind doesn't match its declared
  type, or the name is undefined.
- **`Get(name)`** - walks up the chain.

`execBlock` opens a fresh child `Environment` for each `{...}` block, so
variables declared inside don't leak out. `for` opens its own scope wrapping
init/cond/step/body so the init variable is visible throughout the loop
without escaping it.

### Execution model

1. `Interpreter.Run(prog)` records `Imports` into `i.imported`.
2. Collects every `MethodDef` into `i.methods` (methods are hoisted: callable
   regardless of source order). During collection it enforces two rules:
   no duplicate method names, and no method name that collides with a
   registered builtin whose owning library has been imported (the no-shadowing
   rule extended to builtins - see `evalCall` below).
3. Creates the global `Environment` (`i.global`) and executes `prog.TopLevel`
   statements in source order in that global scope.
4. Method calls execute the body in a fresh call frame whose parent is
   `i.global`, so top-level variables are visible inside methods (subject to
   the no-shadowing rule). Returned values propagate (M2: always `null`, since
   `return` doesn't exist yet).

There is no required entry point. A program with only imports and method
defs is valid and runs to completion immediately (those methods are simply
never called).

### Builtins and libraries

Each library lives in its own Go package under `internal/lib/<name>/` and
registers its functions (and constants) on the interpreter. User-facing
reference docs are split per library:

- [lib_io.md](lib_io.md) - `printf`, `sprintf`, format verbs
- [lib_convert.md](lib_convert.md) - `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `typeOf`
- [lib_math.md](lib_math.md) - `abs`, `min`, `max`, `sqrt`, `pow`, `floor`, `ceil`, `round`, `PI`, `E`
- [lib_strings.md](lib_strings.md) - `len`, `upper`, `lower`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `indexOf`, `trim`/`trimLeft`/`trimRight`, `replace`, `repeat`, `substring`

What follows is the implementation contract, not the user-facing API.

Library functions are Go closures registered with the interpreter:

```go
type Builtin func(out io.Writer, args []Value) (Value, error)

// In a library package:
func Install(in *interpreter.Interpreter) {
    in.Register("io", "printf", printf)
    in.Register("io", "sprintf", sprintf)
}
```

`Interpreter.Builtins` stores `builtinEntry{Lib, Fn}` per name. A call to
`foo(...)` resolves in this order:

1. User-defined method `foo` in `i.methods`.
2. Builtin `foo` - **but only if its owning library has been `use`d**. The
   error otherwise quotes the right library name: `` `foo` requires `use <lib>;` ``.

The no-shadowing check at hoist time uses the same lookup: a user method
that collides with an imported library's builtin is rejected.

Library-provided **constants** (like `math.PI`) are registered via
`Interpreter.RegisterConst(lib, name, value)`. Lookup happens in
`evalExpr`'s `ConstRefExpr` case: user env first, then library constants
gated on the same `use`-check.

For the user-facing API of each library, follow the links above. Below are
the implementation-only notes worth knowing as a maintainer.

**`internal/lib/io`**: `printf` and `sprintf` share a `formatArgs` helper
with three shapes - 0 args errors; first-arg-is-string triggers format
substitution; single non-string arg writes `Display()` (the M2 ergonomic
preserved). `printf` writes to `Interpreter.Out`; `sprintf` returns a
`KindString` value and ignores the writer.

**`internal/lib/math`**: `floor`/`ceil`/`round` accept int (identity) or
float and return `int`. `round` uses Go's `math.Round` (half away from
zero). `PI` and `E` are registered via `RegisterConst`; the `ConstRefExpr`
lookup falls back to library constants when the user env doesn't have the
name, gated on the owning library being `use`d.

**`internal/lib/convert`**: parser side - the `typeCall` production lets
`int(...)`, `float(...)`, `string(...)`, `bool(...)` parse despite their
names being type keywords. `typeOf` is a normal IDENT call. `bool(v)`
implements canonical-only conversion at all source kinds (`0`/`1` for int,
`0.0`/`1.0` for float, `"true"`/`"false"` for string) - non-canonical
values produce a positioned error, not silent coercion.

**`internal/lib/strings`**: all indices and lengths are **rune-based**
(Unicode code points), implemented via `unicode/utf8`. `len` returns the
rune count; `indexOf` returns a rune index (not the byte index Go's
`strings.Index` produces - we translate); `substring` uses a small
`byteOffsetForRune` helper to convert rune-indexed bounds back to byte
slicing on the underlying string. `repeat` guards against multiplication
overflow before calling Go's `strings.Repeat` to avoid the panic in the
standard library. The Go package is named `stringslib` to avoid colliding
with the standard `strings` package, which it depends on heavily.

### Runtime errors

`*runtimeError` carries optional `File`/`Line`/`Col`. Errors render as
`runtime error at FILE:L:C: <msg>` (or `runtime error at L:C: <msg>` when
the file is unknown). All four Jennifer error types - `*lexer.LexError`,
`*preproc.PreprocessError`, `*parser.ParseError`, and `*runtimeError` -
implement a small `Position() (file string, line, col int)` interface. The
CLI uses that interface (no string parsing) to look up the right file and
print a caret under the offending source line.

### Errors and positions (cross-file)

The pipeline plumbs file information through three layers:

1. The lexer attaches the source file path to every token (`Token.File`).
   `TokenizeWithFile(source, file)` is the entry point; the no-arg
   `Tokenize` leaves `File` blank for unattributed input.
2. The preprocessor preserves each spliced token's `File` field when
   resolving `import "path.j";`, so tokens from an imported file keep that
   file's path, line, and column.
3. The parser propagates `File` from tokens to every AST node (each
   `pos` struct carries `File`, `Line`, `Col`). Synthesized nodes (e.g.
   `BinaryExpr`) copy the file from the left operand.

When the interpreter raises a `*runtimeError`, it pulls file/line/col from
the offending node via a small `posFor(node)` helper. The CLI's
`printErrorContext` type-asserts the `positioned` interface, and if the
reported file differs from the program's main file it loads that file from
disk before slicing out the snippet to display.

## CLI (`cmd/jennifer`)

```
jennifer run <file.j>     run a Jennifer program
jennifer run -            read source from stdin
jennifer repl             interactive REPL
jennifer help             show usage
```

- Verifies the `.j` extension
- Reads the file, parses, runs
- On error: prints the message and a source-context caret on stderr, exits `1`
- Bad usage exits `2`

### REPL (`cmd/jennifer/repl.go`)

The REPL drives a read-eval-print loop on top of the standard pipeline. Each
input is lexed, preprocessed, parsed, and fed to `Interpreter.EvalInteractive`
(not `Run`). `EvalInteractive` differs from `Run` in three documented ways:
the global env is lazy-initialized and preserved across calls, library
imports and method definitions are idempotent / re-assignable so the user
can iterate, and the value of a trailing `ExprStmt` is returned so the loop
can print it.

Multi-line input is handled by a small `inputComplete(tokens)` helper that
balances `{`/`(` against `}`/`)` (using the lexer's tokens so string and
comment contents are ignored) and requires the input to end in `;` or `}`.
Anything else triggers a `... ` continuation prompt. Unbalanced *closing*
delimiters intentionally fall through to the parser for diagnosis since no
amount of additional input would fix them.

REPL input is tagged with the synthetic file label `<repl>`. The
cross-file-error snippet loader in `printErrorContext` treats `<repl>` like
`<stdin>`: no external file lookup is attempted, and the current input
buffer is used as the snippet source. Lex errors discard the buffer (since
they cannot become valid by reading more); parse and runtime errors print
and the loop continues.

`:quit` / `:exit` / EOF terminate cleanly; `:help` prints a short reminder.
Directives are only recognized at a fresh prompt so a literal `:quit` inside
a block doesn't short-circuit.

## Testing

| Package                | What it tests                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `internal/lexer`       | Token-by-token output for fixed inputs; error cases |
| `internal/parser`      | AST shape via `Sprint`; precedence; error cases |
| `internal/interpreter` | Full programs in-memory; stdout captured       |
| `internal/lib/io`       | `Install` registers `printf`/`sprintf`; arity and format errors |
| `cmd/jennifer`         | Golden test that runs every `examples/*.j` and compares stdout to `examples/expected/*.txt` |

Run everything with `go test ./...`.

## Rejected features

Proposals that were considered and explicitly turned down. Recorded here so
the same ideas don't come back as fresh suggestions next session.

### Increment / decrement (`++`/`--`)

Considered: postfix `$i++` and prefix `++$i`.

Rejected because:

- The pre/post distinction is a real footgun - the two forms differ only
  in expression context, which is exactly where bugs hide. Swift removed
  `++`/`--` in version 3 (2016) for this exact reason.
- The savings are tiny (three characters) and only apply to `+1` / `-1`.
- Python rejected them from the start and the language hasn't suffered.
- `$i = $i + 1;` is verbose but unambiguous; the readability cost is small.

### Compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `div=`, `%=`)

Considered as an alternative to `++`/`--`.

Rejected because:

- `div=` reads particularly badly - mashing a word-operator into the
  assignment-operator family stands out.
- Several operators to add and remember for marginal ergonomic gain over
  `$x = $x + E;`.
- Slippery slope: would we also need a string-concat `+=`? An `and=`?
  Where does the family end?
- Keeping a single assignment shape (`$x = EXPR;`) makes source code uniform
  and matches Jennifer's "one way to do each thing" stance.

## TinyGo notes

The interpreter is built with TinyGo: `tinygo build -o jennifer ./cmd/jennifer`.

A few constraints shape the implementation:

- **No `reflect`-heavy code.** Tagged-union `Value` instead of interfaces with
  type assertions in hot paths.
- **No `text/template`, no goroutines in the interpreter core.** Not needed
  yet, but worth not introducing accidentally.
- **`testing` runs under regular `go test`.** TinyGo's `testing` support is
  partial; we develop and verify with `go test ./...`.
