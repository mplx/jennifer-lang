# `jwt` - JSON Web Tokens (RFC 7519)

Import with `import "jwt.j" as jwt;`. Sign, verify, and decode compact JWTs.
Claims are a [`json.Value`](../libraries/json.md) object; a token is the usual
`header.payload.signature` of base64url segments.

Ten algorithms across four families:

| Family | Algorithms                | Key (`bytes`)                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| HMAC   | `HS256` / `HS384` / `HS512` | a shared secret                               |
| RSA    | `RS256` / `RS384` / `RS512` | a PEM RSA key (PKCS#1 / PKCS#8 / PKIX)        |
| ECDSA  | `ES256` / `ES384` / `ES512` | a PEM EC key (SEC1 / PKCS#8 / PKIX)           |
| EdDSA  | `EdDSA`                   | a raw Ed25519 key from `crypto.signKeypair`     |

The key is **always `bytes`** - a secret, a PEM blob read from disk, or a raw
Ed25519 key - and which one is decided by the algorithm family.

```jennifer
use convert;
import "jwt.j" as jwt;

def secret as bytes init convert.bytesFromString("topsecret", "utf-8");
def claims as json.Value init json.decode("{\"sub\":\"ada\",\"exp\":9999999999}");

def token as string init jwt.sign($claims, $secret, "HS256");
def back as json.Value init jwt.verify($token, $secret, "HS256");   # throws if invalid
```

## Surface

| Call                          | Returns      | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jwt.sign(claims, key, alg)`  | `string`     | Sign `claims` (a `json.Value`) into a compact JWT.                     |
| `jwt.verify(token, key, alg)` | `json.Value` | Verify the signature, the header algorithm, and `exp` / `nbf`; return the claims. Throws on any failure. |
| `jwt.decode(token)`           | `json.Value` | The payload claims **without verifying** - for inspection only.        |
| `jwt.header(token)`           | `json.Value` | The token header (its `alg` / `kid`), also without verifying.          |

## Verifying safely

`jwt.verify` takes the algorithm you **expect** as its third argument, and this
is deliberate - it is the difference between a safe verifier and a vulnerable
one:

- **Algorithm confusion is rejected.** A token whose header `alg` does not equal
  the `alg` you pass is refused. This closes the classic attack where an
  attacker re-signs a token as `HS256` using your RSA *public* key as the HMAC
  secret: you asked for `RS256`, so the `HS256` token never gets that far. Never
  derive the verification algorithm from the token's own header.
- **`"none"` is not an algorithm.** It is not in the supported set, so a token
  claiming `alg: none` cannot be verified (only `decode`d).
- **Time claims are enforced.** When present, `exp` (expiry) rejects an expired
  token and `nbf` (not-before) rejects one that is not yet valid, both against
  the current time. `NumericDate` claims are Unix seconds.
- **HMAC comparison is constant-time** (`crypto.hmacEqual`), so a wrong MAC
  leaks nothing through timing.
- **Segments must be canonical base64url.** A segment with stray `=` padding or
  non-zero trailing bits decodes to the same bytes as the canonical spelling -
  a *second token string* that verifies as the same token, which breaks
  anything keyed on the token string (replay caches, denylists). Such spellings
  are rejected as malformed, matching strict JWS implementations.

`jwt.decode` and `jwt.header` do **not** verify anything - use them only to read
a token you have not trusted yet (for example, to read `kid` before fetching the
matching key). Never authorize on their output.

## Building claims

Claims are a `json.Value`, so build them however you build JSON - decode a
literal, or assemble one with the `json` write surface:

```jennifer
use json;
use time;
import "jwt.j" as jwt;

def exp as int init time.unix(time.now()) + 3600;      # one hour
def claims as json.Value init json.decode(
    "{\"sub\":\"ada\",\"role\":\"admin\",\"exp\":" + convert.toString($exp) + "}");
def token as string init jwt.sign($claims, $secret, "HS256");
```

## Keys by family

- **HS\***: any `bytes` secret. Use a long, random secret (`crypto.randBytes(32)`).
- **RS\* / ES\***: a PEM key as `bytes` - read it with `fs.readBytes("key.pem")`.
  Signing needs the private key, verifying needs the public key. Standard PEM
  encodings are accepted (RSA PKCS#1 or PKCS#8; EC SEC1 or PKCS#8; public keys in
  PKIX / `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`).
- **EdDSA**: the `public` / `private` `bytes` from `crypto.signKeypair()`.

`jwt` does not generate RSA or EC keys - bring your own (from your identity
provider, or `openssl`). It generates Ed25519 keys through `crypto.signKeypair`.

## JWT as web auth (`jwt_auth`)

There is no separate `jwt_auth` module - JWT authentication is this module used
as a [`web`](web.md) `before` middleware. Register a guard that pulls the bearer
token from the `Authorization` header, verifies it, and rejects on failure:

```jennifer
func requireJwt(ctx as web.Context) {
    def auth as string init web.header($ctx, "Authorization");
    if (not strings.startsWith($auth, "Bearer ")) {
        web.respond($ctx, 401, "missing bearer token");
        return false;                         # stop the chain
    }
    def token as string init strings.substring($auth, 7, len($auth));
    try {
        def claims as json.Value init jwt.verify($token, JWT_SECRET, "HS256");
        web.set($ctx, "user", json.asString($claims, "/sub"));
    } catch (e) {
        web.respond($ctx, 401, "invalid token");
        return false;
    }
    return true;                               # continue to the handler
}
```

## Platforms

HS\* (over `hash.hmac`) and `EdDSA` (over `crypto.sign` / `verify`) run on
**both binaries**. RS\* / ES\* need the `crypto` library's RSA / ECDSA surface,
which is on the default `jennifer` binary; on `jennifer-tiny` they raise a
friendly "not available" error (the same split as `net`).
