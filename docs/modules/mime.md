# `mime` - build and parse MIME messages

Import with `import "mime.j" as mime;`. Builds and parses MIME messages (RFC
5322 headers plus RFC 2045/2046 bodies) - the header-and-boundary structure
behind email. Pure Jennifer over `strings`, `convert`, and `encoding`; it
does **no networking**, so it runs on either binary and is the
message-structure foundation the `mail` protocol clients (SMTP / POP3 /
IMAP) build on.

```jennifer
use io;
import "mime.j" as mime;

def msg as mime.Part init mime.text("text/plain", "Hello, café.");
$msg = mime.withHeader($msg, "Subject", "Hi");
io.printf("%s", mime.encode($msg));

def back as mime.Part init mime.parse(mime.encode($msg));
io.printf("%s\n", mime.body($back));      # Hello, café.
```

## The `Part` model

A message is a `Part` tree. A part is either a **leaf** (headers plus a
decoded-text `body` with a transfer `encoding`) or a **multipart container**
(headers plus child `parts` under a `boundary`):

```jennifer
export def struct Part {
    headers as list of Header, body as string, encoding as string,
    parts as list of Part, boundary as string
};
export def struct Header { name as string, value as string };
```

Bodies are held **decoded, as text**: `encode` applies the transfer encoding
and `parse` removes it, so you always read plain content.

| --------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mime.text(contentType, body)`          | `Part`   | Leaf text part; 7bit if ASCII, else quoted-printable. Adds `charset=utf-8`. |
| `mime.attachment(filename, contentType, body)` | `Part` | Base64 leaf with a `Content-Disposition` filename.               |
| `mime.multipart(subtype, boundary, parts)` | `Part` | Container (`multipart/subtype`) over one boundary.                 |
| `mime.withHeader(part, name, value)`    | `Part`   | Copy with a header set (case-insensitive replace, else append).    |
| `mime.encode(part)`                     | `string` | Serialize to a CRLF MIME message with transfer encodings applied.  |
| `mime.parse(text)`                      | `Part`   | Parse a message: unfold headers, split multipart, transfer-decode. |
| `mime.headerValue(part, name)`          | `string` | Header value (case-insensitive) or `""`.                           |
| `mime.body(part)`                       | `string` | A leaf's decoded text body.                                        |
| `mime.parts(part)`                      | `list of Part` | A container's child parts.                                   |
| `mime.contentType(part)`                | `string` | Media type without parameters (e.g. `text/plain`).                 |
| `mime.address(name, email)`             | `string` | RFC 5322 mailbox: `email`, or `Name <email>` (name quoted, or RFC 2047-encoded when non-ASCII). |
| `mime.encodeWord(text)`                 | `string` | RFC 2047 UTF-8 base64 encoded-word(s), `=?UTF-8?B?...?=`, folded when long. |
| `mime.decodeWord(value)`                | `string` | Decode every encoded-word in a header value back to text (B and Q). |

## Encoding

`encode` produces a canonical message with **CRLF** line endings and picks the
transfer encoding automatically:

- **7bit** - `text` bodies that are pure ASCII pass through unencoded.
- **quoted-printable** - `text` bodies with non-ASCII are QP-encoded (e.g.
  `café` to `caf=C3=A9`).
- **base64** - `attachment` bodies are base64-encoded and folded at 76
  columns.

A multipart container writes its child parts between `--boundary` delimiters
and closes with `--boundary--`; nesting works (a part can itself be a
multipart).

```jennifer
def parts as list of mime.Part init [];
$parts[] = mime.text("text/plain", "plain");
$parts[] = mime.text("text/html", "<b>rich</b>");
def msg as mime.Part init mime.multipart("alternative", "b0", $parts);
io.printf("%s", mime.encode($msg));
```

The boundary is **yours to pass** (not auto-generated), so output is
deterministic and testable; pick a string that cannot appear in the content.

## Parsing

`parse` is the inverse: it splits the header block from the body at the first
blank line, unfolds continuation lines (a header value wrapped onto an
indented next line), reads `Content-Type` / `Content-Transfer-Encoding`, and
either splits a multipart body on its boundary (recursively) or
transfer-decodes a leaf. `encode` and `parse` round-trip:

```jennifer
def back as mime.Part init mime.parse(wire);
for (def part in mime.parts($back)) {
    io.printf("%s: %s\n", mime.contentType($part), mime.body($part));
}
```

## Non-ASCII headers (RFC 2047 encoded-words)

Header values must be ASCII on the wire, so a non-ASCII `Subject` or display
name is carried as an RFC 2047 **encoded-word** (`=?UTF-8?B?...?=`). This is
applied **automatically** and symmetrically:

- `encode` encodes a non-ASCII `Subject` / `Comments` value, and the
  display-name half of an address header (`From` / `To` / `Cc` / `Bcc` /
  `Reply-To` / `Sender`), leaving the `<addr>` untouched. Long values fold
  into several encoded-words split on rune boundaries.
- `parse` decodes those same headers back to plain text - so a fetched
  `Subject: =?UTF-8?B?QmVyaWNodCBhdXMgTcO8bmNoZW4=?=` reads back as
  `Bericht aus München`. A word that fails to decode is left verbatim, so a
  malformed header never crashes `parse`.
- `mime.address("Jörg Müller", "j@x.de")` encodes the name for you.

```jennifer
def m as mime.Part init mime.withHeader(
    mime.text("text/plain", "hi"), "Subject", "Grüße aus München");
io.printf("%s", mime.encode($m));   # Subject: =?UTF-8?B?R3LDvMOfZSBhdXMgTcO8bmNoZW4=?=
```

The primitives `mime.encodeWord` / `mime.decodeWord` are exposed for the cases
the auto-hooks don't cover (a custom header, a multi-address line). Both B
(base64) and Q (quoted-printable) encoded-words decode; encoding always emits
B. `us-ascii` / `iso-8859-*` / `windows-*` charsets decode through
[`encoding`](../libraries/encoding.md); UTF-8 is the default.

## Out of scope

Deliberately a foundation, not a full mail stack:

- **Binary bodies.** A `Part` body is text (UTF-8); an `attachment` takes text
  content. True binary attachments (a `bytes` body, e.g. an image) are not yet
  supported - that needs a `bytes`-typed body field.
- **Multi-address name encoding.** A comma-separated address list is left raw
  on `encode`; encode each mailbox's name with `mime.address` when building it.
- **Networking.** This module only shapes messages; sending / fetching them is
  the `mail` SMTP / POP3 / IMAP clients (built on `mime`).
