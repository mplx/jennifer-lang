# `cron` - cron schedules

Import with `import "cron.j" as cron;`. Parse and evaluate **cron expressions** -
the five-field `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week` spec. `parse` builds
a `Schedule`, `matches` tests whether a `time.Time` fires it, and `next` finds
the next fire at or after a time. A **pure calculator** over `time` - no clock,
no sleeping - so it runs on **both** binaries; a real scheduler is your own
`spawn` + `time.sleep` loop over `cron.next`.

```jennifer
import "cron.j" as cron;

def s as cron.Schedule init cron.parse("30 9 * * 1-5");   # 09:30 on weekdays
def fire as time.Time init cron.next($s, time.now());
io.printf("next run: %s\n", time.iso($fire));
```

Runnable: [`examples/modules/cron_demo.j`](https://github.com/jennifer-language/jennifer/blob/main/examples/modules/cron_demo.j).

## Functions

| Call | Returns | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `cron.parse(expr)` | `Schedule` | Parse a five-field expression. |
| `cron.matches(schedule, t)` | `bool` | Does the schedule fire at `t`? (minute granularity - seconds are ignored). |
| `cron.next(schedule, after)` | `time.Time` | The next fire at or after `after`, keeping its zone offset. |

## Fields

Five whitespace-separated fields, each with the usual operators:

| Field | Range | |
| ----- | ----- | - |
| minute | 0-59 | |
| hour | 0-23 | |
| day of month | 1-31 | |
| month | 1-12 | |
| day of week | 0-7 | `0` and `7` are both Sunday |

Each field accepts `*` (every value), a single number, an `a-b` range, an
`a,b,c` list, and a `/n` step - on a wildcard (every `n`th value), a range
(`a-b/n`), or a value (`a/n`, meaning `a` to the field maximum). Examples:

| Expression | Fires |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `* * * * *` | every minute |
| `*/15 * * * *` | every 15 minutes |
| `0 9 * * 1-5` | 09:00 on weekdays (Mon-Fri) |
| `0 0 1 * *` | midnight on the 1st of each month |
| `30 3 * * 0` | 03:30 on Sundays |
| `0 0 13 * 5` | midnight on Friday the 13th (see below) |

### The day-of-month / day-of-week rule

When **both** the day-of-month and day-of-week fields are restricted (neither is
`*`), a day matching **either** one fires - the standard cron behavior. So
`0 0 13 * 5` fires on the 13th *and* on every Friday. When one of the two is `*`,
only the other constrains the day.

## `next`

`cron.next(schedule, after)` returns the first matching minute at or after
`after` (with its seconds zeroed), preserving the input's zone offset. If `after`
already sits exactly on a matching minute, it is returned. The search skips
non-matching days whole (so a yearly schedule is found quickly) and gives up
after a five-year horizon - an impossible schedule (e.g. `0 0 31 2 *`, February
31st) throws a catchable `Error` (kind `"cron"`) rather than looping forever.

Zones are fixed-offset (as in the `time` library), so `next` does no DST
arithmetic.

## Scope

- **Standard five fields.** No seconds field, no `@daily` / `@reboot` macros, and
  no non-standard extensions (`L`, `W`, `#`, `?`).
- **A calculator, not a runner.** It never touches the clock. Drive it yourself:
  `time.sleep(time.sub(cron.next($s, time.now()), time.now()))`, then run the job.
