# `core` - auto-loaded structural builtins

The `core` library is special: it is **automatically available** in every
Jennifer program. You do **not** write `use core;` - the interpreter
pre-imports it at startup. Writing `use core;` is a runtime error to
keep source files honest about which libraries the program actively
invokes.

```jennifer
use io;

printf("running Jennifer %s\n", JENNIFER_VERSION);
```

(no `use core;` needed; `JENNIFER_VERSION` is already in scope.)

## Why `core` is special

Jennifer's library discipline is "nothing for free": every standard
library is opt-in via `use NAME;`. `core` is the deliberate exception,
reserved for a tiny handful of *structural* builtins that every program
needs without ceremony - things that are more like language operators
than library functions. Reserve membership carefully; almost everything
new belongs in `io`, `math`, `convert`, `strings`, or a new
domain-library, not here.

## Functions

| Call              | Returns | Notes                                                       |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `len(v)`          | int     | Structural length, polymorphic                              |
| `has(m, key)`     | bool    | Map membership test                                         |

### `len`

Polymorphic - the same name covers every type where "structural length"
is well-defined:

- **string** → rune count (Unicode code points, not bytes)
- **list**   → element count
- **map**    → entry count

Passing any other kind (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `null`) is a positioned
runtime error.

```jennifer
printf("%d\n", len("hello"));      # 5
printf("%d\n", len("héllo"));      # 5 (rune count)
printf("%d\n", len([1, 2, 3]));    # 3
printf("%d\n", len({"a": 1, "b": 2})); # 2
```

### `has`

Reports whether a map contains a given key. The companion to the M6
decision that *reads* of missing keys are runtime errors: when you
need to test for a key without erroring, use `has`.

```jennifer
def m as map of string to int init {"a": 1};
if (has($m, "a")) {
    printf("%d\n", $m["a"]);    # safe to read; we just checked
}
```

`has` only accepts maps. The string-side question "does this haystack
contain this needle?" is `strings.contains`. A future list-side
`contains` would slot under [strings](strings.md) or a new collections
namespace.

## Constants

| Name               | Kind     | Value                                                  |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `JENNIFER_VERSION` | string   | The interpreter's build version (see format below).    |

The `JENNIFER_` prefix follows the precedent set by `PHP_VERSION` and
`RUBY_VERSION` (and similar from other languages). It also leaves the
unprefixed namespace clean for host/environment constants
(`PLATFORM`, `OSNAME`, `ARCH`, ...) when those land.

### `JENNIFER_VERSION` string format

The build pipeline derives `JENNIFER_VERSION` from
`git describe --tags --long`:

| Repository state                          | `JENNIFER_VERSION` value              |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| HEAD is exactly on a semver tag           | `"0.4.0"`                             |
| HEAD is N commits past the most recent tag | `"0.4.0-dev+2.1023204"`              |
| No tags exist yet                         | `"0.0.0-dev+<N>.<shortsha>"`          |
| Built without git (or outside a repo)     | `"dev"`                               |

The `dev+` prefix is intentional: any non-tagged build is a development
build, and the `N.shortsha` suffix lets you trace which commit produced it.

## Build flow

`JENNIFER_VERSION` is set at build time by a small codegen step. The
Makefile runs `scripts/gen-version.sh` before `tinygo build` /
`go build`, writing a generated `internal/version/version_gen.go` whose
`init()` assigns `version.Version` to the string from
`scripts/version.sh`. The `core` library then mirrors that into the
interpreter as the `JENNIFER_VERSION` constant.

You don't need to run the codegen step manually if you build via `make
build` (TinyGo) or `make build-go` (Go). A bare `go test ./...` skips
codegen and uses the default `"dev"` baked into `version.go`.

Codegen rather than `go build -ldflags -X` is used because TinyGo 0.41
silently ignores `-X`. The generated file is `.gitignore`d.

## Roadmap

Future candidates for `core` membership (none committed yet):
`PLATFORM`, `BUILDTIME`, runtime introspection like `JENNIFER_TARGET`.
Each one needs to clear the bar of "universally needed structural
primitive that's more like an operator than a library function."
