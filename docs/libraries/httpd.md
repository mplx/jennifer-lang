# `httpd` - HTTP server engine

Enable with `use httpd;`. An HTTP/1.1 server engine wrapping Go's `net/http`,
so keep-alive, chunked transfer, TLS (and HTTP/2 over TLS), request timeouts,
and graceful shutdown come from the battle-tested Go stack rather than being
re-implemented in the interpreter. It is the server counterpart to the `net`
client primitives and the [`http`](../modules/http.md) client module.

**Default binary only.** Like `net`, `httpd` needs a network stack, so it runs
on the standard `jennifer` build; on `jennifer-tiny` every call returns a
friendly error (TinyGo ships no netdev driver). See
[technical/tinygo.md](../technical/tinygo.md).

## The pull loop

Jennifer has no first-class functions, so you cannot hand Go a request handler
callback. Instead the engine accepts and parses requests concurrently on Go's
side and hands them to your program **one at a time**: `httpd.accept` blocks
for the next request, and `httpd.respond` answers it.

```jennifer
use httpd;

def srv as httpd.Server init httpd.listen("127.0.0.1:8080");
while (true) {
    def req as httpd.Request init httpd.accept($srv);
    httpd.respond($req, 200, "hello\n");
}
```

The two concurrency worlds stay cleanly separate: **Go owns the I/O
concurrency** (accepting, parsing, keep-alive), and your program stays a simple
serial loop. When you *want* per-request parallelism, opt into it with your own
`spawn` - several `spawn`ed workers can each call `httpd.accept` on the same
server handle to form a worker pool, since the handle's state is shared:

```jennifer
use httpd;
use task;

def srv as httpd.Server init httpd.listen("127.0.0.1:8080");
def workers as list of task of null init [];
for (def i in lists.range(0, 4)) {
    $workers[] = spawn {
        while (true) {
            def req as httpd.Request init httpd.accept($srv);
            httpd.respond($req, 200, "handled by a worker\n");
        }
    };
}
```

## Surface

| Call | Returns | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `httpd.listen(addr)` | `httpd.Server` | Start listening (`"127.0.0.1:8080"`, `":0"` for an ephemeral port). |
| `httpd.listenTLS(addr, cert, key)` | `httpd.Server` | HTTPS; `cert` / `key` are PEM `bytes`. HTTP/2 negotiated automatically. |
| `httpd.address(srv)` | `string` | The actual bound address (resolve `":0"` to the chosen port). |
| `httpd.accept(srv)` | `httpd.Request` | Block for the next request. Errors once the server is shut down. |
| `httpd.method(req)` | `string` | `"GET"`, `"POST"`, ... |
| `httpd.path(req)` | `string` | URL path, e.g. `/users/42`. |
| `httpd.query(req, name)` | `string` | Query parameter (`""` if absent). |
| `httpd.header(req, name)` | `string` | Request header (`""` if absent; case-insensitive name). |
| `httpd.body(req)` | `bytes` | The request body (buffered, capped at 10 MiB). |
| `httpd.remoteAddr(req)` | `string` | Client `host:port`. |
| `httpd.setHeader(req, name, value)` | `null` | Set a response header (before `respond`). |
| `httpd.respond(req, status, body)` | `null` | Send the response; `body` is a `string` or `bytes`. |
| `httpd.serveFile(req, path)` | `null` | Answer with a file (content type, range requests handled by `net/http`). |
| `httpd.serveDir(req, root)` | `null` | Answer with the file under `root` matching the request path (`..` cannot escape `root`). |
| `httpd.shutdown(srv)` | `null` | Graceful drain: stop accepting, unblock parked `accept` calls, finish in-flight requests. |

Each request must be answered **exactly once** - a second `respond` /
`serveFile` / `serveDir` on the same request, or a `setHeader` after the
answer, is an error.

## Handles

`httpd.Server` and `httpd.Request` are `{id as int}` handles into a Go-side
registry (the same pattern as `fs`, `net`, `os.Process`): value-semantic to
copy, but every copy refers to the same underlying server / request. That is
what lets a copied `Server` handle inside a `spawn` worker pull from the same
accept queue.

## A tiny JSON API

Everything the engine hands you is a value, so the rest of the standard library
composes normally - here, `json` for the response body:

```jennifer
use httpd;
use json;

def srv as httpd.Server init httpd.listen(":8080");
while (true) {
    def req as httpd.Request init httpd.accept($srv);
    def out as json.Value init json.map();
    $out = json.set($out, "/method", httpd.method($req));
    $out = json.set($out, "/path", httpd.path($req));
    httpd.setHeader($req, "Content-Type", "application/json");
    httpd.respond($req, 200, json.encode($out));
}
```

## Static files

```jennifer
use httpd;
def srv as httpd.Server init httpd.listen(":8080");
while (true) {
    def req as httpd.Request init httpd.accept($srv);
    httpd.serveDir($req, "./public");
}
```

`serveDir` cleans the request path so a `../` cannot climb above `root`;
`serveFile` answers with one specific file regardless of the request path.

## Graceful shutdown

`httpd.shutdown` closes the listener, wakes any workers blocked in
`httpd.accept` (they get an error so their loops can exit), and lets in-flight
requests finish before returning. A typical server installs a signal handler
(via `os`) that calls `shutdown`, or shuts down after a sentinel request.

## Scope and limits

- **HTTP/1.1** over plaintext; **HTTP/2** is negotiated automatically over TLS
  by `net/http`.
- The request body is buffered with a **10 MiB cap**; a configurable limit and
  explicit read/idle/write timeout knobs are a planned follow-up.
- **Routing, path parameters, middleware, cookies, sessions** are not in the
  engine - they belong to the `web` framework module built on top of it, which
  does name-based handler dispatch itself (the engine never calls back into the
  interpreter). See [milestones.md](../milestones.md).
