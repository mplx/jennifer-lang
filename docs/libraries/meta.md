# `meta` - interpreter identity and reflection

Enable with `use meta;`. Holds facts about the running Jennifer
interpreter itself - the build version, which Go toolchain compiled
it, and similar information that programs typically log for bug
reports, embed in error messages, or branch on for build-specific
behaviour - plus a small **reflection** surface for invoking a
top-level method by a runtime string name (`meta.call` / `meta.defined`
and their entry-program siblings `meta.callMain` / `meta.definedMain`).

This is distinct from `os` (which is about the *host environment* -
operating system, CPU architecture, environment variables) and from
the rest of the standard library (which is about user data).

```jennifer
use io;
use meta;

io.printf("Jennifer %s (%s build)\n",
    meta.VERSION, meta.BUILD);
```

## Constants

| Name           | Kind   | Value                                                              |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `meta.VERSION`   | string | The interpreter's build version. See format below.                 |
| `meta.BUILD`     | string | Which Go toolchain compiled the interpreter: `"go"` or `"tinygo"`. |
| `meta.SYSMODDIR` | string | The resolved system module directory (where bare `import`s look). Resolved from `--sysmoddir` > `JENNIFER_SYSMODDIR` > the compile-time default; `jennifer version -v` shows the layers. |

### `VERSION` string format

The build pipeline derives `meta.VERSION` from
`git describe --tags --long`:

| Repository state                           | `meta.VERSION` value         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| HEAD is exactly on a semver tag            | `"0.4.0"`                    |
| HEAD is N commits past the most recent tag | `"0.4.0-dev+2.1023204"`      |
| No tags exist yet                          | `"0.0.0-dev+<N>.<shortsha>"` |
| Built without git (or outside a repo)      | `"dev"`                      |

The `dev+` prefix is intentional: any non-tagged build is a development
build, and the `N.shortsha` suffix lets you trace which commit produced it.

### `BUILD` values

`meta.BUILD` distinguishes which Go variant compiled the
interpreter binary. Useful because TinyGo has subtly different runtime
behaviour from standard Go (different GC, different scheduler tuning,
different stdlib subset) - a program that needs build-specific behaviour
or just wants to log "which interpreter is this for the bug report" can
branch on this value.

| Value      | Meaning                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"go"`     | Built with the standard Go toolchain (`gc`) - the default `jennifer` binary |
| `"tinygo"` | Built with TinyGo - the constrained `jennifer-tiny` binary         |

`make build` produces both binaries: the default `jennifer` (standard
Go, `meta.BUILD == "go"`) and `jennifer-tiny` (TinyGo, `meta.BUILD ==
"tinygo"`). `make build-go` and `make build-tinygo` produce only one
each. `go run` against the source also reports `"go"`. If a future
alternative compiler shows up, its identifier passes through directly
rather than being normalised - so the constant always reports honestly
what built the binary.

## Reflection - calling a method by name

Jennifer has no first-class functions: a bare call `greet(...)` is
resolved at compile time, so you cannot dispatch on a name computed at
runtime. `meta.call` closes that gap - it invokes a top-level user
method by a runtime string, the general form of what `testing.run` does
for tests.

| Call | Returns | |
| ---- | ------- | - |
| `meta.call(name, args...)` | the method's return value | Invoke the method `name` with the given arguments (arity + declared types checked, as at a normal call site). |
| `meta.defined(name)` | bool | Whether a method `name` exists - validate a name before calling it. |
| `meta.callMain(name, args...)` | the method's return value | Like `call`, but resolves against the **entry program's** methods. |
| `meta.definedMain(name)` | bool | Like `defined`, against the entry program. |

```jennifer
use io;
use meta;

func greet(name as string) { return "hi " + $name; }

io.printf("%s\n", meta.call("greet", "ada"));   # hi ada
io.printf("%t\n", meta.defined("nope"));         # false
```

Unlike `testing.run`, `meta.call` is transparent: it does not catch
`exit`, and every sentinel a normal call can raise - a runtime error, a
thrown `Error`, `exit` - propagates to the caller, catchable with
`try` / `catch`.

### `callMain` / `definedMain` - reaching the entry program

Modules run on isolated sub-interpreters, so a `meta.call` *inside a
module* reaches that module's own methods, not the program that imported
it. The `*Main` variants cross that boundary: they resolve against the
**entry program's** top-level methods. This is what lets a framework
module dispatch to handlers the application defined - the
[`web`](../modules/web.md) module registers routes against handler names
and calls them with `meta.callMain`. Called from the entry program
itself, `callMain` / `definedMain` coincide with the plain forms (the
entry program is its own host). Struct arguments are re-tagged across the
boundary automatically, so a module can pass one of its own struct values
(e.g. a `web.Context`) to an entry-program handler that declares it.

## Build flow

`meta.VERSION` is set at build time by a small codegen step.


The Makefile runs `scripts/gen-version.sh` before `tinygo build` /
`go build`, writing a generated `internal/version/version_gen.go` whose
`init()` assigns `version.Version` to the string from
`scripts/version.sh`. The `meta` library then mirrors that into the
interpreter as the `meta.VERSION` constant.

You don't need to run the codegen step manually if you build via `make
build` (TinyGo) or `make build-go` (Go). A bare `go test ./...` skips
codegen and uses the default `"dev"` baked into `version.go`.

Codegen rather than `go build -ldflags -X` is used because TinyGo 0.41
silently ignores `-X`. The generated file is `.gitignore`d.

## Roadmap

`meta` is a new library and intentionally small. Future candidates if
they earn their slot: build time, git SHA (separated from the version
string), REPL-vs-script mode, runtime GC stats, scheduler diagnostics.
The library exists in part to give those a natural home when they
land.
