# Jennifer - User Guide

Jennifer is a small, experimental, interpreted programming language. This
guide covers everything you can do in Jennifer. Run
`jennifer version` to see which build you're on; the language history
lives in [docs/milestones.md](../milestones.md).

## Design stances

A handful of decisions shape every feature in Jennifer. Read them
before the topical chapters - they explain why the language looks the
way it does and rule out the "but why don't you just..." reflex.

See [docs/design-stances.md](../design-stances.md) for the full
seven-stance table.

## Contents

- [Installing & running](installing.md) - building the binary, running a
  program, the interactive REPL, the inspection and formatting commands.
- [Your first program](first-program.md) - a one-screen `hello.j` and a
  walkthrough of what each line does.
- [Editor & AI support](tooling.md) - syntax highlighting for your editor,
  and the drop-in `JENNIFER.md` that lets an AI assistant write Jennifer.
- [Syntax](syntax.md) - tokens, comments, identifier rules.
- [Types and values](types-and-values.md) - the primitive types,
  variables and constants, scoping rules, and the compound types
  `list` and `map`.
- [Methods](methods.md) - declaring methods, parameters, return values,
  recursion, hoisting, the no-shadowing rule for builtins.
- [Control flow](control-flow.md) - operators, precedence, `if` / `while`
  / `for` / for-each.
- [Imports](imports.md) - `use LIB;` for libraries, `import "file.j";` for
  source files, the library catalog.
- [Examples](examples.md) - small programs that exercise the language
  end-to-end.
- [Style guide](style-guide.md) - the canonical source style that
  `jennifer fmt` produces; the spacing/indentation rules, the names
  convention, the `[]` and `{}` literal layout.
- [Best practices](best-practices.md) - stylistic guidance and
  code-smell heuristics for writing Jennifer that ages well. Not
  enforced by the language; click through if you want the "why".

  standard library (`io`, `convert`, `math`, `strings`, ...).
- [docs/modules/](../modules/index.md) - the Jennifer-coded modules that
  ship with the interpreter, brought in with `import` (`ansi`, `csv`,
  `mime`, `redis`, ...).

  contributors.
- [docs/glossary.md](../glossary.md) - canonical project terminology.
  When two words could plausibly name the same concept (function vs
  method, library vs module, list vs array), this page picks the one
  the project uses everywhere.
- [docs/milestones.md](../milestones.md) - what's shipped, what's
  planned.
