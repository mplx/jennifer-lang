# Jennifer style guide

This is the recommended source style for Jennifer programs. `jennifer fmt`
re-emits source in exactly this shape, so anything you write that matches
the spec will survive a `fmt` round-trip unchanged.

The guide is short on purpose: there are only a handful of rules, but they
are consistent. If you've used `gofmt`, `prettier`, `rustfmt`, or PSR-12,
nothing here will surprise you.

## Spacing

- **One space around every binary operator**: `$i = 1 + 2;`, not
  `$i=1+2;`. Applies to `+ - * / // % < > <= >= == and or` and `=`.
- **Unary `-` hugs its operand**: `-5`, `-$x`, `-fact($n - 1)`. No space
  between the `-` and the value it negates.
- **Word-form unary operators take a space**: `not $ok`, never `not$ok`.
  Same goes for any other keyword operator the language grows.
- **One space after `,` and `;` inside `for (...; ...; ...)`**, never
  before. `for (def i as int init 0; $i < 10; $i = $i + 1)`.
- **No space inside parentheses**: `printf("hi")`, not `printf( "hi" )`.
- **One space between a keyword and its `(`**: `if (cond)`, `while (cond)`,
  `for (...)`. Function calls don't get this space: `printf(...)`.
- **No space inside `[ ]` or `{ }` list/map literals**: `[1, 2, 3]`,
  `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`, not `[ 1, 2, 3 ]` or `{ "a" : 1 }`. Empty
  literals are `[]` and `{}`. Same rule as `()`.
- **No space before `[`**: `$xs[0]`, not `$xs [0]`. Index expressions
  hug their target.
- **No space inside `[]` for the M9 append form**: `$xs[] = item;`,
  never `$xs[ ] = item;` or `$xs [ ] = item;`. Same rule as `$xs[0]`
  hugs its target and its brackets.
- **One space after `:`** in map literals, never before: `{"a": 1}`,
  not `{"a" :1}` or `{"a":1}`.
- **No trailing whitespace** on any line.

## Indentation

- **4 spaces per level**, no tabs. Re-indenting on `}` always lands you
  back on a multiple of 4.
- One level per block - method body, `if`/`elseif`/`else` body, `while`
  body, `for` body.

## Braces

- **1TBS (one true brace style): opening brace on the same line**
  for *everything* - methods and control flow alike - separated by
  one space: `func fact(n as int) {`, `if ($x > 0) {`, `else {`.
  (Jennifer uses the uniformly-same-line variant that Java, Go,
  Rust, and the Linux kernel also use.)
- **`}` on its own line**, except for the `} else {` / `} elseif (...) {`
  cascade, where `else`/`elseif` continues on the same line as the
  preceding `}`.
- **`fmt` always expands blocks across multiple lines** - the canonical
  form has the opening brace at end-of-line, each body statement on its
  own indented line, and the closing brace on its own line. Single-line
  blocks are still legal source (the parser accepts them), but `fmt`
  rewrites them to the expanded form for consistency.

## Statements

- **Every statement ends with `;`** - no exceptions, including the last
  statement in a block.
- **One statement per line**. Don't chain multiple statements with `;`
  on a single line.
- **Blank lines separate logical groups** - imports from method
  definitions, methods from top-level code, distinct steps within a long
  block. Never more than one consecutive blank line.

## Loops

- **Declare the iterator variable inside the `for` init**, not in the
  surrounding scope. The variable's lifetime should match the loop's:

  ```jennifer
  for (def i as int init 0; $i < 10; $i = $i + 1) {   # preferred
      printf("%d\n", $i);
  }
  ```

  not

  ```jennifer
  def i as int;
  for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i = $i + 1) {                # avoid
      printf("%d\n", $i);
  }
  ```

  The loop-local form is self-contained (reading the `for` line tells
  you everything about `i`), keeps the iterator out of the surrounding
  scope, and matches the for-each shape (`for (def x in $coll)`) which
  is *always* loop-local. The outer-scope form is only justified when
  you genuinely need the iterator's value after the loop ends - for
  example, to report which iteration triggered a break in a future
  language version that adds `break`. Use it deliberately, not by
  habit.
- **One concern per loop.** If the body is more than a screen,
  consider whether the work belongs in a helper method called from
  inside the loop.

## Names

- **Variables, methods, parameters**: lowercase or `camelCase` if the name
  has multiple words. Identifiers are `[A-Za-z]{1,64}` - no digits, no
  underscores.
- **Constants**: `UPPERCASE`, with `_` as a single word separator. The
  full rule is `[A-Z]+(_[A-Z]+)*`, up to 64 characters: one or more
  uppercase chunks joined by single `_`. Every `_` must be immediately
  followed by `[A-Z]` - no leading, trailing, or consecutive `_`.
  Examples: `MAX`, `MAX_RETRIES`, `HTTP_OK`, `A_B_C`. Digits and
  lowercase letters are not allowed.
- **Library names**: lowercase, single word where possible (`io`, `math`,
  `strings`, `meta`).

## Namespaced calls

Domain libraries are addressed by `prefix.name(...)`. The dot binds
tight on both sides, like a method call's `(`:

- **No space around `.`**: `os.platform()`, never `os . platform()`.
- **The call parens still hug the callee**: `os.platform()`, not
  `os.platform ()`.
- **`use lib as alias;` is one space on each side of `as`**:
  `use bio as b;`, never `use bio  as  b;`.

When you alias a library, the canonical name is freed for ordinary
identifier use (e.g. you *could* write `func os() { ... }` after
`use os as o;`). Don't. Reusing a library's canonical name reads as
"this is a call into the library" at first glance, then surprises
the reader when it isn't - keep the canonical name out of the
user-method pool even when aliasing has technically freed it.

## Strings

- **Prefer double quotes**: `"hello"` over `'hello'`. Both forms parse
  escape sequences the same way, but mixing styles in one file reads as
  noise. Use single quotes only when the string contains a `"` you'd
  otherwise need to escape.
- **Escape sequences are explicit**: `"\n"`, `"\t"`, `"\\"`. Don't rely
  on multi-line string literals - Jennifer doesn't have them.

## Comments

- `# line comment` for short notes that belong on or just above the
  thing they describe. The very first line may be a shebang
  (`#!/usr/bin/env -S jennifer run`); the lexer treats it as a comment.
- `/* block comment */` for longer commentary that doesn't fit one line.
  Block comments don't nest.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. The code already says what.

## Source file conventions

- **`.j` extension** for all Jennifer source. The interpreter rejects
  anything else.
- **One SPDX header at the top** of every committed `.j` file (the
  project uses `LGPL-3.0-only` - see existing examples).
- **`use` and `import` statements come first**, before any methods or
  top-level statements. Group `use` lines together, then `import` lines,
  then a blank line, then the rest of the program.
- **Blank line after a leading comment block.** If the file opens with
  a header comment (SPDX line, copyright, file description, shebang),
  leave one blank line between the comment block and the first code
  line. Files that start directly with code (no header) start on
  line 1 - no leading blank.
- **Trailing newline** at end of file.

## Editor configuration

Drop the following into a `.editorconfig` file at your project root and
[any editor with EditorConfig support](https://editorconfig.org/#download)
will enforce the spacing and file-encoding rules above automatically:

```ini
# .editorconfig
root = true

[*.j]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
```

That covers the indentation rule (4 spaces, no tabs), trailing-whitespace
and final-newline conventions, and pins UTF-8 + LF line endings so
collaborators on different OSes don't accidentally introduce CRLF
diffs. `jennifer fmt` re-emits source in the same shape, so the
EditorConfig settings and the formatter never disagree.

If you keep `.j` files alongside other languages in one repository, add
a generic fallback as the first block so plain text files don't drift
either:

```ini
[*]
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
```

## Limitations

`jennifer fmt` (v1) operates on the lexer's token stream and re-emits
canonical source. As a consequence:

- **Comments are dropped.** The lexer strips `#` and `/* */` at scan
  time. Preserving them would require carrying comments as tokens, which
  is a future enhancement.
- **Blank lines aren't preserved or inserted.** The formatter packs
  statements one per line at the appropriate indent without inserting
  vertical whitespace between logical groups. You can still write blank
  lines in source, but they don't survive a `fmt` round-trip.

Both limitations are listed in `docs/milestones.md` for tracking.

## A complete example

```jennifer
use io;
func fact(n as int) {
    if ($n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return $n * fact($n - 1);
}
for (def i as int init 0; $i <= 8; $i = $i + 1) {
    printf("%d! = %d\n", $i, fact($i));
}
```

Everything in this example follows the rules above: 1TBS braces, 4-space
indent, spaces around binary operators, double-quoted strings, expanded
blocks, no blank lines (a limitation - see above). `jennifer fmt` will
produce this output byte-for-byte from any equivalent input.

The SPDX header (`# SPDX-License-Identifier: ...`) and copyright comment
that the project's source files carry are stripped by `fmt` today; keep
them in version control via your normal workflow and re-apply after a
reformat until the comment-preservation enhancement lands.
