# Grammar - PEG

The operational view of the grammar: a Parsing Expression Grammar whose
**ordered choice** and **predicates** encode exactly the decisions
`internal/parser/parser.go` makes (a recursive-descent parser with fixed
lookahead *is* a PEG evaluator, minus the backtracking it never needs).
Where the [EBNF](grammar_ebnf.md) says *what shapes exist*, this grammar says
*which alternative wins and why*. The two describe the same language and must
be kept in sync; the parser is the source of truth for both.

Like the EBNF, this describes the token stream **after** preprocessing
(`include` splices are already expanded). Terminals in CAPITALS are token
classes from the lexer ([Lexer > Token types](lexer.md#token-types)); quoted
strings are keywords or punctuation matching one token. Because the terminals
are whole tokens, the classic PEG longest-match ordering concern (`"<="`
before `"<"`) does not arise here - the lexer already decided; ordering below
matters only where two alternatives share a *token* prefix.

Notation: `<-` defines, `/` is ordered choice (first match wins, no
reconsidering), `?` `*` `+` repeat greedily, `&e` succeeds iff `e` matches
(consuming nothing), `!e` succeeds iff `e` does not match (consuming
nothing).

# --- statements --------------------------------------------------------------
# The parser dispatches on the leading token; the keyword alternatives are
# mutually exclusive, so their relative order is free. Within the VARREF-

# The four VARREF-rooted statements. AssignStmt first mirrors the parser's
# `$x =` peek; AppendStmt's "[" "]" prefix cannot be an IndexAssign (an index
# expression never starts at "]"), but trying it first keeps the intent
# obvious. In `(LvalueStep !"=")*` the not-predicate stops the greedy star
# one step early, leaving the FINAL `[index]` / `.field` - the one directly
# before "=" - for the explicit tail. Without the predicate a greedy star
# would swallow the last step and the alternative could never match.

# After a bare IDENT the next token decides, in this order: "." starts a

# WordName: any identifier-shaped token - a plain IDENT or a keyword spelled
# like one (every Jennifer keyword is). Name positions (after a ".", field
# names in struct definitions and literals) are contextually unambiguous, so

# `def struct Route { from as Point, to as Point };`, `$r.to`.

WordName     <- IDENT / KEYWORD

# `task` is a type keyword, not an IDENT, so the IDENT-led call rules
# (PlainCall / QualifiedCall) never match it; TaskExpr below is the one

                 # `P{}` parses; "every field present exactly once" is a

                 # "{" is a block opener in statement position and a map

                 # Statement and Expr contexts keeps the two from meeting
```

## Reading the load-bearing orderings

Three places where PEG's first-match-wins is doing real work, and what the
parser does at the same juncture:

- **`Statement`: `ExprStmt` last.** The parser peeks: `$x` followed by `=`
  is an assignment, `$xs[...]...` ending in `= expr ;` an index/field
  assignment, and only a `$x` chain *not* followed by `=` falls through to
  an expression statement. Ordered choice reproduces that priority; putting
  `ExprStmt` earlier would shadow every assignment form.
- **`IdentSuffix` / `QualifiedSuffix`: call before constant.** The parser
  decides `call` vs `constRef` (and `qualifiedCall` vs `qualifiedConstRef`)
  by peeking for `(`. In PEG the bare-name alternative simply comes last: if
  `CallArgs` matches, it was a call; only when nothing longer matches does
  the name stand alone.
- **`IndexAssign` / `FieldAssign`: `(LvalueStep !"=")*`.** PEG repetition is
  greedy and never gives back, so `LvalueStep* "[" Expr "]"` could not work -
  the star would consume the final step. The `!"="` predicate stops the star
  exactly one step before the `=`, which is precisely the parser's approach
  of scanning the l-value chain while watching for the assignment that
  terminates it.
