# Rejected features

Proposals that were considered and explicitly turned down. Recorded here so
the same ideas don't come back as fresh suggestions next session.

## Increment / decrement (`++`/`--`)

Considered: postfix `$i++` and prefix `++$i`.

Rejected because:

- The pre/post distinction is a real footgun - the two forms differ only
  in expression context, which is exactly where bugs hide. Swift removed
  `++`/`--` in version 3 (2016) for this exact reason.
- The savings are tiny (three characters) and only apply to `+1` / `-1`.
- Python rejected them from the start and the language hasn't suffered.
- `$i = $i + 1;` is verbose but unambiguous; the readability cost is small.

## Compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`)

Considered as an alternative to `++`/`--`.

Rejected because:

- Several operators to add and remember for marginal ergonomic gain over
  `$x = $x + E;`.
- Slippery slope: would we also need a string-concat `+=`? An `and=`?
  Where does the family end?
- Keeping a single assignment shape (`$x = EXPR;`) makes source code uniform
  and matches Jennifer's "one way to do each thing" stance.

## Ternary operator (`cond ? a : b`)

Considered as a way to write expression-position conditional
selection without bouncing through an intermediate variable:

```jennifer
# verbose - status quo
def grade as string;
if ($score >= 90) { $grade = "A"; } else { $grade = "B"; }

# what a ternary would let us write
def grade as string init $score >= 90 ? "A" : "B";
```

Python's `a if c else b` and the C-family `c ? a : b` cover the
same need.

Rejected because:

- **Parallel API to `if`/`else`.** Stance #1 is strict in Jennifer
  (`++` was rejected even though it's syntactically distinct from
  `$i = $i + 1`). "Pick value A or B based on a condition" is one
  operation; `if`/`else` is the canonical spelling. Adding a second
  syntax form would be the same kind of parallel API that `++` and
  `+=` were rejected for.
- **Closest stance neighbor agrees.** Go is the only mainstream
  language built on a "small, explicit" stance comparable to
  Jennifer's, and Go's designers rejected ternary explicitly: "The
  reason `?:` is absent from Go is that the language's designers
  had seen the operation used too often to create impenetrably
  complex expressions. The if-else form, although longer, is
  unquestionably clearer." Real Go code lives without it; Jennifer
  programs will too.
- **Nesting is the footgun.** `a ? b : c ? d : e ? f : g` is
  parseable but unreadable. Once shipped, the ternary will end up
  in code like this and there's no way to take it back. Rejecting
  upfront saves us the migration.
- **Verbose form has search/step affordances.** A multi-line
  `if`/`else` is grep-friendly, debuggable, and editable line by
  line. The condensed expression form is none of these. For one
  saved line of source across the whole program, the cost is too
  high.
- **Escape hatch already exists.** A user who really wants
  ternary-shaped code can write a one-line helper
  `func pick(c as bool, a as int, b as int) { if ($c) { return $a; } return $b; }`.
  Both arguments evaluate eagerly (no short-circuit), but for the
  cases where ternary is genuinely better this is fine.

The "make `if` itself an expression" alternative (Rust-style:
`def x init if (c) { 1 } else { 2 };`) was also considered and
deferred indefinitely. It's the cleaner long-term answer if
expression-position conditionals ever become genuinely needed -
it extends an existing construct rather than introducing a new
operator - but it's a much larger change (blocks have to evaluate
to their last expression; type-checking gets harder; `if` without
`else` and `if` containing `return`/`exit` need defined semantics).
We don't owe ourselves that complexity for "save one line of
source" ergonomics.

## Range literal syntax (`[1..9]`)

Considered as a shorthand for constructing a `list of int`
sequence:

```jennifer
# what range literal would let us write
def xs as list of int init [1..9];
for (def i in [1..len($items)]) { ... }
```

Borrowed from Haskell / Kotlin / Ruby's syntactic form.

Rejected because:

- **Parallel API to the `[1, 2, 3]` list literal.** Two syntaxes
  for "construct a `list of int`" - same family as `++`, `+=`,
  and ternary. Stance #1 has rejected every previous instance.
- **Hides materialization cost (stance #2).** `[1..big_number]`
  silently allocates a million-element list. The explicit
  `for (def i init 1; $i <= n; ...)` loop iterates without
  materializing, and the cost shows up at the call site instead
  of being buried in a two-character `..` operator. A library
  function call (`lists.range(...)`) makes the allocation
  visible too; the literal form does not.
- **New single-purpose operator.** Jennifer hasn't introduced an
  operator that works in exactly one context before; every other
  operator (`+ - * / // % & | ^ ~ << >> < > <= >= == and or not`)
  works across multiple types or contexts. `..` only does
  integer ranges. Once it ships we'd have to defend "why doesn't
  `[1.0..9.0]` work? why not `["a".."z"]`?" - each extension
  another design discussion.
- **Pattern set elsewhere.** Jennifer ships `lists.head` /
  `lists.tail` instead of Python `xs[:n]` / `xs[n:]` slicing
  syntax; `strings.substring` instead of `s[i:j]`; index-write
  `$xs[i] = v;` instead of pythonic `$xs[i:i+1] = [v]`. Library
  functions over syntax for collection operations is the
  established Jennifer pattern.

The chosen rule: ship `lists.range(start, end)` (M15.0) as the
canonical way to allocate an integer sequence. Use site reads as
"this allocates a list" instead of hiding behind two characters
of punctuation. See
[milestones.md > M15.0](../milestones.md#m150---existing-library-extensions).

## printf data-transformation modifiers

Considered during the M7 format-verb-modifier design: extending the
modifier list with options that transform the *value* rather than its
*visual representation*. Examples from the original draft:

- `%s|case=upper|lower|title|snake|kebab|camel|pascal|leet`
- `%s|slice=START:END`
- `%s|md=italic|bold|code|strike|header1|header2|...|link(URL)|...`
- `%s|md=table(...)` and the wider `%a|json=*`/`%a|xml=*`/`%a|yaml=*`
  family - serialisation modifiers for the aggregate verb. `%a`
  itself shipped in M11 with presentation-only modifiers (`sep`,
  `kv`, `open`, `close`, `depth`, `null=skip`); the
  `json=`/`xml=`/`yaml=` family remains rejected as data
  transformation that belongs in dedicated libraries.
- `null=sql` (SQL-specific spelling of `NULL`)

Rejected for the modifier system because:

- **Mission creep.** The guiding rule for printf modifiers is "shape
  the printed representation, not the value." `%d|base=2` is presentation
  (the int 5 becomes the glyph sequence `101`). `%s|case=upper` is data
  transformation (`"abc"` becomes `"ABC"` - a different string value).
  Once one transform is in, every string/number/aggregate manipulation
  becomes a candidate modifier and the format-string spec swallows the
  rest of the standard library.
- **Parallel API to the libraries.** `%s|case=upper` is already
  `strings.upper($s)`. Two ways to do the same thing breaks Jennifer's "one
  way per thing" stance and means every future string helper has to
  decide whether to ship as a function, a modifier, or both.
- **Domain leakage.** `null=sql` picks one application domain to bake
  into the formatter. `null=literal("NULL")` is already general -
  letting the user spell their own NULL keeps SQL, CSV, JSON, and any
  future format out of the printf spec.
- **`md=*` is a separate library.** Markdown rendering belongs in a
  future `markdown` library that returns strings, so the result
  composes with `printf`, `sprintf`, string concat, file writing -
  anywhere a string goes. Folding it into `%s` modifiers would lock
  markdown output to print sites.

## printf literal-pipe lookahead

Considered during M7 as a way to soften the breaking change to pre-M7
format strings: treat the `|` after a verb as a literal whenever the
*next* byte isn't a lowercase letter, so `"%s|%s"` would keep working
because `|%` isn't a key start.

Rejected because the rule is context-sensitive in exactly the wrong
direction. A user who writes `"%s|fill text"` (intending literal `|`)
would suddenly hit a parse error because `fill` is a valid-looking
key, while `"%s|9 lives"` would silently keep working because `9`
isn't a letter. The footgun moves around with whatever word follows
the verb.

The chosen rule is the strict one: `|` immediately after a verb
always starts a modifier list. To write a literal `|` in that
position, double it (`||`), parallel to the `%%` escape for a
literal `%`. The rule is uniform and easy to remember; the migration
cost was small (five test strings in this repo).

## Methods on structs

Considered during M15.4 (`time` library) planning: let structs
declare methods that receive `self` implicitly, so accessors and
small operations on a struct value read as `$t.year()` instead of
`time.year($t)`. The trigger was the time library's many calendar
accessors; the same shape would later cover `hash.Stream.update`,
`os.Process.kill`, and every other library that holds onto state
behind a struct.

Rejected because:

- **It's the start of object orientation, not a syntactic shortcut.**
  Methods carry an implicit `self` binding and re-open the question
  of polymorphism, dispatch (single? double?), inheritance vs
  composition, interfaces / traits, visibility modifiers, and
  constructors. Once any one of those is shipped the others
  become a "why not also" thread. Jennifer is procedural with
  value types; the small, explicit shape is the language's
  identity, not a placeholder for an OO upgrade.
- **It invalidates every shipped library's call shape.** Today
  `lists.push($xs, x)`, `maps.has($m, k)`, `strings.upper($s)`,
  `hash.update($s, $b)`, `os.run($argv)` are all
  `lib.verb(receiver, args...)`. Adding `$receiver.verb(args...)`
  alongside would force each library to choose - or worse, ship
  both spellings and create the parallel-API problem stance #1
  rejects. Picking method-form everywhere would mean rewriting
  every library and every example.
- **Stances #1 and #2 already cover the ergonomics complaint.**
  "One way per thing" - if methods exist the function form
  becomes the second way. "Explicit over implicit" - the
  function call shows the library name at the call site; the
  method form hides it behind dispatch on `$receiver`'s type.
  The cost of `time.year($t)` vs `$t.year()` is one extra word;
  the cost of OO is a different language.

The chosen rule: structs have field access only. Operations on
struct values live as functions in the owning library
(`time.year($t)`, `hash.update($s, $b)`, `os.kill($p)`). If
ergonomics ever genuinely justify a receiver syntax, the
language change is large enough to merit its own milestone with
its own rejected.md trail of what the OO surface would *not*
include.

## `os.exit(n)`

Considered during the M11 / M15.1 planning: ship process exit as
both the language statement `exit EXPR;` (M11) and as a library
function `os.exit(n)` (planned for M15.1). The argument for keeping
both was that the language statement might be redefined under a
future embedding (McFly OS, a WASM sandbox) to mean "return from the
interpreter," while `os.exit(n)` would always mean "kill the host
process" with no possibility of redefinition. Same argument as C's
`exit()` vs `_exit()`.

Rejected because:

- **They collapse to the same thing today.** On a hosted OS the two
  forms have identical observable behaviour - same exit code, same
  stdout flush, same termination. Two spellings for one behaviour
  violates Jennifer's "one way per thing" stance immediately, in
  exchange for a divergence that hasn't been needed yet.
- **The embedding case is hypothetical.** McFly OS embedding and a
  WASM-sandbox build are long-horizon items; designing the public
  API for them now locks in a duplicate that the actual embeddings
  may not even want (an embedded host might redefine `exit EXPR;`
  *and* `os.exit(n)` the same way, leaving the distinction useless
  but still in the language).
- **The statement form is the right home.** Process exit is
  control-flow, parallel to `return;`: terminating execution from
  any reachable point. Wrapping the same primitive in a library
  function would read as "call into the OS" when it's actually
  "stop running." The statement form keeps the intent visible.

The chosen rule: `exit EXPR;` (and bare `exit;`) is the only
spelling. If a future embedding does need a "always kill the host"
escape hatch, it ships then with a name that says what it does
(`os.kill()`, `os.hardExit()`), not as a near-duplicate of the
existing statement.

## Implicit `use NAME;` fallback chain (M8+)

Considered during the M8-and-beyond roadmap discussion: have
`use http;` search the system libraries first, then any installed
WASM libraries, then a `http.j` on the file-import path, taking the
first one found. Same call-site spelling regardless of where the
implementation actually lives.

Rejected because:

- **It violates "explicit over implicit."** Two programs with the
  same source text would resolve `use http;` to different
  implementations depending on what's installed in the environment.
  At the call site (`http.get(...)`) the reader has no way to tell
  which `http` is in scope.
- **Silent precedence shifts break things.** Installing a WASM
  `http` package would shadow a (slower / different-flavoured)
  system `http`. The user's program would change behaviour with no
  source edit and no visible diff.
- **Debuggability suffers.** "Why does `http.get` behave this way?"
  becomes "which `http` did the resolver pick this time?" - a
  question that depends on the environment, not the code.

The chosen rule is explicit prefixes - the load source is visible
at the `use` site:

- `use net;` → system library only.
- `use wasm:libname;` → WASM library (when that milestone lands).
- `import "path/foo.j";` → file import (textual splice today;
  module-aware when M17 lands).

Users who genuinely want one entry point can write a tiny
Jennifer-coded shim that picks an implementation explicitly;
that's a per-program decision, not a language-wide default.

## FFI as a single milestone

Considered: a dedicated "FFI" milestone covering everything users
typically mean by foreign function interface - calling C libraries,
calling Go libraries, integrating with OS APIs, embedding Jennifer
in host applications, reusing existing ecosystems.

Rejected because it's three different problems wearing one name,
and lumping them together obscures that two are already addressed
and the third doesn't fit:

- **"Call Go libraries" is already the library mechanism.** Every
  `<pkg>.Install(in)` call registers Go functions as Jennifer
  builtins. That *is* FFI in everything but name. Anyone wanting
  to extend Jennifer with Go code writes a topic library today;
  no new surface needed.
- **"Integrate with OS APIs" is the topic-library job.** `os`,
  `fs`, `net`, and friends wrap Go's stdlib (which wraps the
  OS). Adding more OS surface means filling out those libraries,
  not inventing an FFI keyword.
- **"Reuse existing ecosystems / call C libraries" lands through
  WASM (M19), not cgo.** TinyGo's cgo support is partial on
  hosted targets and absent on WASI / baremetal; macflyos has no
  userspace libc to link against. The WASM runtime milestone
  already plans sandboxed module loading, which sidesteps the
  ABI / marshalling / ownership fight entirely.
- **"Embed Jennifer in host applications" is a real gap - but
  it's a Go-side polish job, not a language feature.** It gets
  its own placeholder in the Long horizon list under
  "Host-embedding API", separate from FFI as conventionally
  meant.

The chosen rule: no FFI milestone. Three named homes instead -
topic libraries (Go + OS surface), WASM (M19, third-party
ecosystems), and a future host-embedding API milestone (driving
the interpreter from Go).

## References, interior mutability, shared mutable state

Considered as escape hatches from the deep-copy cost that
stance #5 (value semantics for collections) imposes on graph
algorithms, large data structures, and zero-copy workflows.
Three different shapes, considered together because they all
relax the same invariant:

- **Mutable references.** A `&xs` form that lets a callee
  write through to the caller's binding (Go / C++ semantics).
- **Interior mutability.** A wrapper type (Rust's `Cell` /
  `RefCell`) carrying a mutable cell behind an otherwise-immutable
  value, settable from anywhere holding the wrapper.
- **Shared mutable state.** A first-class "shared list" or
  "shared map" kind whose writes are visible to every binding
  that points at the same underlying storage.

Rejected because:

- **They break the local-reasoning guarantee that value
  semantics is the whole point of.** Today a reader of
  `func f(xs as list of int)` knows the caller's binding cannot
  be mutated by `f` - no aliasing, no surprises. Any of the
  three above forces every reader to ask "does this callee
  have a writable handle on my data?" at every call site. The
  cost is paid by every program, not just the ones that need
  the optimization.
- **Rust gets away with this only because the borrow checker
  pays the bill.** Aliased mutation in Rust is sound because
  the type system rejects programs where two writable handles
  coexist. Jennifer has no such checker and the language's
  whole point is local readability without a type-system tax;
  adding aliased mutation without the checker is just C
  semantics with prettier syntax.
- **Pre-1.0 softening is a one-way door.** Once any of these
  ships, the "no aliasing" guarantee is gone for every future
  reader. Even gating them behind a keyword (`shared`, `&mut`)
  forces every other Jennifer programmer to learn the
  aliased-mutation rules to read other people's code.
- **The performance gap is recoverable without semantic
  change.** Copy-on-write, arena allocation, and read-only
  slice views (`xs[1..5]` as a non-owning window that errors
  on assignment) close most of the gap that motivates the
  proposals. Those are interpreter-internal optimizations -
  they preserve "no aliasing" at the user level and are
  recorded as the "Performance & memory" placeholder in the
  Long horizon list. Graph algorithms specifically can use the
  M13.1 struct mechanism with explicit ID-keyed maps
  (`map of int to Node`) for parent / child links, which is
  the conventional fix in value-typed languages.
- **Shared state for concurrency belongs to M16.0.** The
  concurrency milestone already plans channel / queue / spawn
  primitives that handle the cross-task communication case
  without exposing shared mutable values to single-threaded
  code.

The chosen rule: stance #5 stands without exception. The
"Performance & memory" Long horizon entry covers the
optimizations that close the cost gap; users who genuinely
need aliased mutation are using the wrong language.
