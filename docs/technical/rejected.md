# Rejected features

Proposals that were considered and explicitly turned down. Recorded here so
the same ideas don't come back as fresh suggestions next session.

## Increment / decrement (`++`/`--`)

Considered: postfix `$i++` and prefix `++$i`.

Rejected because:

- The pre/post distinction is a real footgun - the two forms differ only
  in expression context, which is exactly where bugs hide. Swift removed
  `++`/`--` in version 3 (2016) for this exact reason.
- The savings are tiny (three characters) and only apply to `+1` / `-1`.
- Python rejected them from the start and the language hasn't suffered.
- `$i = $i + 1;` is verbose but unambiguous; the readability cost is small.

## Compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`)

Considered as an alternative to `++`/`--`.

Rejected because:

- Several operators to add and remember for marginal ergonomic gain over
  `$x = $x + E;`.
- Slippery slope: would we also need a string-concat `+=`? An `and=`?
  Where does the family end?
- Keeping a single assignment shape (`$x = EXPR;`) makes source code uniform
  and matches Jennifer's "one way to do each thing" stance.

## printf data-transformation modifiers

Considered during the M7 format-verb-modifier design: extending the
modifier list with options that transform the *value* rather than its
*visual representation*. Examples from the original draft:

- `%s|case=upper|lower|title|snake|kebab|camel|pascal|leet`
- `%s|slice=START:END`
- `%s|md=italic|bold|code|strike|header1|header2|...|link(URL)|...`
- `%s|md=table(...)` and the wider `%a|json=*`/`%a|xml=*`/`%a|yaml=*`
  family (deferred along with the rest of `%a`)
- `null=sql` (SQL-specific spelling of `NULL`)

Rejected for the modifier system because:

- **Mission creep.** The guiding rule for printf modifiers is "shape
  the printed representation, not the value." `%d|base=2` is presentation
  (the int 5 becomes the glyph sequence `101`). `%s|case=upper` is data
  transformation (`"abc"` becomes `"ABC"` - a different string value).
  Once one transform is in, every string/number/aggregate manipulation
  becomes a candidate modifier and the format-string spec swallows the
  rest of the standard library.
- **Parallel API to the libraries.** `%s|case=upper` is already
  `strings.upper($s)`. Two ways to do the same thing breaks Jennifer's "one
  way per thing" stance and means every future string helper has to
  decide whether to ship as a function, a modifier, or both.
- **Domain leakage.** `null=sql` picks one application domain to bake
  into the formatter. `null=literal("NULL")` is already general -
  letting the user spell their own NULL keeps SQL, CSV, JSON, and any
  future format out of the printf spec.
- **`md=*` is a separate library.** Markdown rendering belongs in a
  future `markdown` library that returns strings, so the result
  composes with `printf`, `sprintf`, string concat, file writing -
  anywhere a string goes. Folding it into `%s` modifiers would lock
  markdown output to print sites.

## printf literal-pipe lookahead

Considered during M7 as a way to soften the breaking change to pre-M7
format strings: treat the `|` after a verb as a literal whenever the
*next* byte isn't a lowercase letter, so `"%s|%s"` would keep working
because `|%` isn't a key start.

Rejected because the rule is context-sensitive in exactly the wrong
direction. A user who writes `"%s|fill text"` (intending literal `|`)
would suddenly hit a parse error because `fill` is a valid-looking
key, while `"%s|9 lives"` would silently keep working because `9`
isn't a letter. The footgun moves around with whatever word follows
the verb.

The chosen rule is the strict one: `|` immediately after a verb
always starts a modifier list. To write a literal `|` in that
position, double it (`||`), parallel to the `%%` escape for a
literal `%`. The rule is uniform and easy to remember; the migration
cost was small (five test strings in this repo).

## Methods on structs

Considered during M15.2 (`time` library) planning: let structs
declare methods that receive `self` implicitly, so accessors and
small operations on a struct value read as `$t.year()` instead of
`time.year($t)`. The trigger was the time library's many calendar
accessors; the same shape would later cover `hash.Stream.update`,
`os.Process.kill`, and every other library that holds onto state
behind a struct.

Rejected because:

- **It's the start of object orientation, not a syntactic shortcut.**
  Methods carry an implicit `self` binding and re-open the question
  of polymorphism, dispatch (single? double?), inheritance vs
  composition, interfaces / traits, visibility modifiers, and
  constructors. Once any one of those is shipped the others
  become a "why not also" thread. Jennifer is procedural with
  value types; the small, explicit shape is the language's
  identity, not a placeholder for an OO upgrade.
- **It invalidates every shipped library's call shape.** Today
  `lists.push($xs, x)`, `maps.has($m, k)`, `strings.upper($s)`,
  `hash.update($s, $b)`, `os.run($argv)` are all
  `lib.verb(receiver, args...)`. Adding `$receiver.verb(args...)`
  alongside would force each library to choose - or worse, ship
  both spellings and create the parallel-API problem stance #1
  rejects. Picking method-form everywhere would mean rewriting
  every library and every example.
- **Stances #1 and #2 already cover the ergonomics complaint.**
  "One way per thing" - if methods exist the function form
  becomes the second way. "Explicit over implicit" - the
  function call shows the library name at the call site; the
  method form hides it behind dispatch on `$receiver`'s type.
  The cost of `time.year($t)` vs `$t.year()` is one extra word;
  the cost of OO is a different language.

The chosen rule: structs have field access only. Operations on
struct values live as functions in the owning library
(`time.year($t)`, `hash.update($s, $b)`, `os.kill($p)`). If
ergonomics ever genuinely justify a receiver syntax, the
language change is large enough to merit its own milestone with
its own rejected.md trail of what the OO surface would *not*
include.

## `os.exit(n)`

Considered during the M11 / M15.1 planning: ship process exit as
both the language statement `exit EXPR;` (M11) and as a library
function `os.exit(n)` (planned for M15.1). The argument for keeping
both was that the language statement might be redefined under a
future embedding (McFly OS, a WASM sandbox) to mean "return from the
interpreter," while `os.exit(n)` would always mean "kill the host
process" with no possibility of redefinition. Same argument as C's
`exit()` vs `_exit()`.

Rejected because:

- **They collapse to the same thing today.** On a hosted OS the two
  forms have identical observable behaviour - same exit code, same
  stdout flush, same termination. Two spellings for one behaviour
  violates Jennifer's "one way per thing" stance immediately, in
  exchange for a divergence that hasn't been needed yet.
- **The embedding case is hypothetical.** McFly OS embedding and a
  WASM-sandbox build are long-horizon items; designing the public
  API for them now locks in a duplicate that the actual embeddings
  may not even want (an embedded host might redefine `exit EXPR;`
  *and* `os.exit(n)` the same way, leaving the distinction useless
  but still in the language).
- **The statement form is the right home.** Process exit is
  control-flow, parallel to `return;`: terminating execution from
  any reachable point. Wrapping the same primitive in a library
  function would read as "call into the OS" when it's actually
  "stop running." The statement form keeps the intent visible.

The chosen rule: `exit EXPR;` (and bare `exit;`) is the only
spelling. If a future embedding does need a "always kill the host"
escape hatch, it ships then with a name that says what it does
(`os.kill()`, `os.hardExit()`), not as a near-duplicate of the
existing statement.

## Implicit `use NAME;` fallback chain (M8+)

Considered during the M8-and-beyond roadmap discussion: have
`use http;` search the system libraries first, then any installed
WASM libraries, then a `http.j` on the file-import path, taking the
first one found. Same call-site spelling regardless of where the
implementation actually lives.

Rejected because:

- **It violates "explicit over implicit."** Two programs with the
  same source text would resolve `use http;` to different
  implementations depending on what's installed in the environment.
  At the call site (`http.get(...)`) the reader has no way to tell
  which `http` is in scope.
- **Silent precedence shifts break things.** Installing a WASM
  `http` package would shadow a (slower / different-flavoured)
  system `http`. The user's program would change behaviour with no
  source edit and no visible diff.
- **Debuggability suffers.** "Why does `http.get` behave this way?"
  becomes "which `http` did the resolver pick this time?" - a
  question that depends on the environment, not the code.

The chosen rule is explicit prefixes - the load source is visible
at the `use` site:

- `use net;` → system library only.
- `use wasm:libname;` → WASM library (when that milestone lands).
- `import "path/foo.j";` → file import (textual splice today;
  module-aware when M17 lands).

Users who genuinely want one entry point can write a tiny
Jennifer-coded shim that picks an implementation explicitly;
that's a per-program decision, not a language-wide default.
