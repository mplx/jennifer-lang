`def` introduces a variable or constant binding (TOKEN_DEFINE); `func`
introduces a method (TOKEN_FUNC). `import` (TOKEN_IMPORT) is for **file
imports** (`import "path.j";`); `use` (TOKEN_USE) is for **library imports**
(`use io;`). `DOT` (`.`) no longer appears in import syntax (paths are
strings now) and is reserved for future expression use.
Comparison tokens `LE`, `GE`, `EQ`, `NEQ` are two-character (`<=`, `>=`, `==`,
`!=`) and are recognized by a one-character lookahead from `<`, `>`, `=`, `!`.
`!` exists **only** as the lead of `!=` (logical negation is the word `not`); a
bare `!` is a positioned lex error whose message points at both `not` and `!=`.
`RETURN` is the keyword behind `return [EXPR];` (see [grammar.md](grammar.md)).

`VARREF` carries the variable name *without* the leading `$`.
`STRING` carries the value *with* escape sequences already processed and *without*
surrounding quotes.

## Whitespace handling

Spaces, tabs and newlines are discarded between tokens; they only
ever advance `Line` / `Col` for position tracking. There is no
indentation-significant mode and no off-side rule. The user-facing
consequence is documented in
[user-guide/syntax.md > Tokens and whitespace](../user-guide/syntax.md#tokens-and-whitespace);
the rule is load-bearing for `jennifer fmt`, which trusts that
re-emitting the token stream with canonical spacing produces a
semantically identical program.

The only place whitespace is *retained* is inside string literals -
`readString` reads byte-by-byte until the closing quote, so a literal
space, tab, or even a raw `\n` between the quotes becomes part of
the string value. Escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, ...) are the
conventional spelling; raw multi-line literals work too but aren't
the canonical form `fmt` produces.

Comments and blank lines are emitted as **trivia tokens**
(`TOKEN_COMMENT_LINE`, `TOKEN_COMMENT_BLOCK`,
`TOKEN_COMMENT_SHEBANG`, `TOKEN_BLANK_LINE`) so `jennifer fmt`
can round-trip them. The preprocessor and parser strip these
tokens at entry; the formatter walks the raw lexer stream. See
[Comments](#comments) below.

## Position tracking

Every token records `Line` and `Col` (both 1-based) and `File` (the absolute
path supplied to `TokenizeWithFile`, or `""` for unattributed input). The
`advance()` helper bumps `line` on `\n` and otherwise bumps `col`. `File`
flows from the token to the AST node (every node embeds `pos{File, Line,
Col}`), so errors raised inside an imported `.j` still point at the
imported file - see [Interpreter > Errors and positions](interpreter.md#errors-and-positions-cross-file).

## Keywords

The lexer's keyword map covers: `def func as init const import use return if
elseif else while for true false null and or not int float string bool`.
Anything else lexed as a word stays a `TOKEN_IDENT`. `define` is **not** a
keyword and lexes as a plain identifier. `div` was removed when `//` took
over floor division.

## Comments

`# ...` runs to end of line and emits `TOKEN_COMMENT_LINE`; the special
case of `#!` on line 1 col 1 emits `TOKEN_COMMENT_SHEBANG` instead so
the formatter can re-emit the shebang verbatim at the file head.
`/* ... */` emits `TOKEN_COMMENT_BLOCK` and **nests** via a depth
counter (increment on `/*`, decrement on `*/`, exit at depth 0).
Unterminated nested comments error positionally at the outermost `/*`
so the message points at where the user meant to start.

Each comment token's `Lexeme` carries the verbatim source text
including the delimiters (`# ...`, `/* ... */`, `#! ...`) so the
formatter round-trips byte-for-byte.

Runs of blank lines collapse to one `TOKEN_BLANK_LINE` per run -
matching the style rule "never more than one consecutive blank line".

`#` was chosen (over the C/Java `//` style) so the floor-division
operator `//` is unambiguous and a Jennifer file can begin with a
Unix shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env -S jennifer run`).

## Identifier rule

Variable, method, parameter and library names use `[A-Za-z]{1,64}` only -
no digits, no underscores. Constants use a looser form: uppercase chunks
separated by single `_` characters - `[A-Z]+(_[A-Z]+)*`. Every `_` must
be immediately followed by `[A-Z]`, so leading, trailing and consecutive
underscores are all rejected.

The lexer reflects this by accepting `_` as a continuation character for
bare IDENT tokens (so `MAX_RETRIES` is a single token) but rejecting any
identifier that *ends* with `_`. The full per-kind rule is then enforced
by the parser at each def / use site - variables, methods, parameters,
library names and call callees may not contain `_`; constants may, with
the leading-`_` case already excluded by `isIdentStart`. `$var` references
go through a separate lexer path (`readVarRef`) that still uses the
strict letters-only `isIdentPart`, so `$foo_bar` lex-errors directly.
