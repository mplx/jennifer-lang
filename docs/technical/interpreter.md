# Interpreter (`internal/interpreter`)

A tree-walking evaluator.

## Runtime values

`Value` is a tagged union (single concrete struct) rather than a Go interface
hierarchy. This avoids `reflect` and method-table indirection, which keeps the
binary small and predictable under TinyGo.

```go
type Value struct {
    Kind    ValueKind  # KindNull | KindInt | KindFloat | KindString |
                       #  KindBool | KindList | KindMap | KindBytes |
                       #  KindStruct (M13.1)
    Int     int64
    Float   float64
    Str     string
    Bool    bool
    List    []Value      # KindList:   element data
    Map     []MapEntry   # KindMap:    insertion-ordered entries
    Bytes   []byte       # KindBytes:  raw bytes
    Fields  []StructField # KindStruct: ordered (Name, Value) per definition
    StructName string    # KindStruct: matches the StructDef name
    ElemTyp *parser.Type # KindList: declared element type (stamped)
    KeyTyp  *parser.Type # KindMap:  declared key type   (stamped)
    ValTyp  *parser.Type # KindMap:  declared value type (stamped)
}
```

`ZeroFor(t parser.Type)` returns the zero value for each declared type and is
used when a `def` omits its `init` clause: `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `false`,
`null`, an empty `[]` list (typed by the declaration), or an empty `{}` map.
`Value.AsFloat()` handles int->float promotion for arithmetic and
comparison; `Value.Equal()` implements `==` (same-kind comparison, plus
the numeric-promotion rule across `int` and `float`; deep-equal for
lists; order-insensitive key→value equality for maps).

### Parameterized Type

`parser.Type` is a recursive struct: `{ Kind TypeKind; Element,
KeyType, ValType *Type }`. Compound types nest naturally
(`list of list of int`). Equality (`Type.Equal`) is structural.

### Value semantics

Lists and maps are **value-typed** in Jennifer: `$ys = $xs;` behaves
as a copy, function parameters bind by copy, and `const` is deep.
No aliasing is observable from user code.

**M16.5.1 - shared-marker COW.** The implementation uses a lazy
copy-on-write protocol so the common "grow a list one element at a
time" pattern doesn't pay an O(N) deep-copy per write. `Value` gains
a `shared *bool` marker:

- `Value.Share()` is called by `evalExpr` for every `VarExpr`. It
  points `shared` at a `*bool = true` so downstream storage of the
  returned value (Define, Assign, param binding, list/map element
  slot, etc.) sees the value as potentially aliased.
- `Value.Ensure()` is called at every mutation site
  (`execAppend`, `execIndexAssign`, `execFieldAssign`). If the flag
  is set, Ensure DeepCopies into a fresh backing before returning.
  Otherwise it's a pass-through - the append/assign hot loop
  mutates in place with no allocation.
- `Value.Copy()` is now the public deep-copy alias for library
  callers whose pattern is "Copy then mutate freely" (e.g.
  `lists.shuffle`, `lists.reverse`). Same historical behaviour;
  the new name is `DeepCopy()`.
- `snapshotForSpawn` calls `DeepCopy()` directly since goroutine-
  boundary crossings need genuine independence.

The marker is one-directional: once `true` it never flips back.
That's pessimistic but correct - a Value that was ever aliased
detaches on next mutation even if the alias has since gone out of
scope. Full refcounted COW would let unaliased mutations stay
in-place at the cost of a small counter; it's a possible future
optimisation. The current design gives the O(1) win on the write
pattern that matters (append in a loop where the binding is the
sole reference) without maintenance of a real refcount.

Aliasing correctness is exercised by
[`internal/interpreter/value_alias_test.go`](https://github.com/mplx/jennifer-lang/blob/main/internal/interpreter/value_alias_test.go) -
every "shared then mutated" corner case (nested lists, structs
containing lists, function-argument mutation, chained lvalues,
etc.). Anyone changing the mutation logic must add coverage there.

### Type stamping

After a literal like `[1, 2, 3]` evaluates, the resulting `Value` has
no `ElemTyp`. The declared type lives only on the receiving binding's
`DeclType`. To make subsequent operations - index-writes, parameter
checks, iteration types - have inner-type info without re-consulting
the declaration, the interpreter calls `stampDeclaredType(v, declType)`
at every binding boundary. The helper writes `ElemTyp` / `KeyTyp` /
`ValTyp` onto the value and recurses into nested compound elements so
deep type tracking is preserved for nested `$xs[i][j] = ...` writes.

### Index access

- **Reads** (`evalIndex`): out-of-bounds list indices and missing map
  keys are positioned runtime errors. Reads return the slot value by
  copy via Go's struct semantics, but the inner slice headers still
  alias - which is fine because reads can't mutate anything.
- **Writes** (`execIndexAssign` / `execFieldAssign`, M13.1): both
  route through the unified `collectLvalueSteps` +
  `applyLvalueWrite` walker. The walker descends through the
  chain (any mix of `[index]` and `.field` nodes) on a fresh copy
  of the root binding, writes via `writeIndexedSlot` (index leaf)
  or the per-struct-field type check (field leaf), then commits
  back through `env.Assign`. Const enforcement fires once against
  the root binding (deep constness). Map writes to a missing key
  extend the map (insertion order preserved); writes to an
  existing key update in place. Struct field writes are
  type-checked against the declared field type stored in the
  `StructDef`.

### Structs (M13.1)

User-defined struct types live in `Interpreter.structs`
(`map[string]*parser.StructDef`), populated at `Run` time by hoisting
every top-level `def struct` before any other statement executes.
This mirrors the method-hoisting pass, and the same duplicate-name
check applies (`Run` rejects two structs with the same name; the
REPL silently redefines).

Per-instance values use `KindStruct` and carry the struct name plus
a `[]StructField` (each entry is `{Name, Value}`). The field slice is
stored in declaration order so `%v` rendering and `Equal` checks are
deterministic. `Copy()` deep-copies every field so value semantics
hold; `MatchesDeclared` matches by name (`p` typed `Point` matches
`Point`-typed declarations only).

The `def x as Name;` no-init path is handled by `zeroStructFor`,
which recurses through nested struct-typed fields so every leaf
field gets its declared zero. Unknown struct names are rejected here
and at `execDefine` time before the init expression is evaluated, so
the user sees `"unknown struct type"` rather than a misleading
type-mismatch error.

### Library-provided namespaced structs (M15.2)

Libraries register their own struct types via
`Interpreter.RegisterNamespacedStruct(libName, structName, fields)`.
The definition lands in `i.NSStructs` keyed by `nsKey{NS, Name}`,
parallel to `NSBuiltins` and `NSConstants`. Users write
`def x as os.Result;` for the type and `os.Result{ ... }` for the
literal; both forms resolve at use time via `resolveNamespacePrefix`
so aliases (`use os as o; def x as o.Result;`) work the same way as
they do for namespaced function calls and constants.

At runtime the value carries both `StructName` and an optional
`StructNS` tag. `MatchesDeclared` and `Equal` compare on the
`(NS, Name)` pair so a library `os.Result` is a distinct type from a
user-defined `Result`; `Display` prefixes the namespace
(`os.Result{exitCode: 0, ...}`). Field access, chained lvalues
(`$r.exitCode`, `$line.from.x = 5;`), value semantics, and deep
`const` all reuse the M13.1 user-struct machinery - only the
type-resolution path differs.

User code may not register namespaced structs; the API is Go-side
only. Programs that want to declare their own structs keep using
the M13.1 `def struct Name { ... };` bare form.

### Iteration

`execForEach` opens a fresh per-iteration scope so the loop variable
binding doesn't leak out and `def`-rebindings don't accumulate. For
lists it walks elements in order; for maps it walks keys in
insertion order. The underlying map representation is a parallel
slice (`[]MapEntry`) rather than a Go `map[K]V` precisely to make
this iteration deterministic and testable.

## Environment

`Environment` is a parent-linked scope frame. Each frame carries two
storage backends for the same set of bindings:

- **`vars map[string]Binding`** - the name-keyed view. Present in
  every frame; the only view the REPL exercises because each REPL
  turn is a fresh parse with no resolver context linking it to
  prior-turn globals.
- **`slots []Binding`** (M16.5.2) - the slot-indexed view. Sized
  from `Block.NumSlots` at frame construction (`NewEnvironmentSized`)
  or grown on demand from `DefineAt`. Empty when the resolver
  didn't run.

`Binding{Value, DeclType, IsConst, Slot}` carries an extra `Slot`
field so name-based writes can mirror into slot storage. `Slot` is
`-1` on bindings installed by name-only `Define` (REPL, ad-hoc AST);
non-negative when the resolver's `DefineAt` created it.

Storing the declared type lets `Assign` reject type-mismatching writes (you
cannot assign a string to a variable declared as int).

**Name-based API** (fallback path):

- **`Define(name, val, declType, isConst)`** - adds to the current
  frame; errors if the name exists *anywhere in the chain* (the spec
  forbids shadowing). Sets `Binding.Slot = -1`.
- **`Assign(name, val)`** - walks up the chain to find the binding;
  errors if the binding is a constant, the value's kind doesn't match
  its declared type, or the name is undefined. When the target's
  `Binding.Slot >= 0`, the write also lands in `cur.slots[Slot]` so
  the two views stay in sync.
- **`Get(name)`** and **`GetBinding(name)`** - walks up the chain.

**Slot-based API** (M16.5.2 fast path):

- **`DefineAt(slot, name, val, declType, isConst)`** - installs the
  binding at `slots[slot]` (growing the slice if needed) and mirrors
  into `vars[name]` with `Binding.Slot = slot`.
- **`GetAt(depth, slot, name)`** - walks `depth` parents then indexes
  `slots[slot]`. Falls back to `vars[name]` at the same depth when
  the slot is out of range (covers execution paths added to a
  resolver-less frame).
- **`GetBindingAt(depth, slot, name)`** - metadata companion to
  `GetAt`.
- **`AssignAt(depth, slot, name, val)`** - const / type-mismatch
  checks match the name path; on success writes to both `slots[slot]`
  and `vars[name]`.

`NewEnvironmentSized(parent, numSlots)` is the M16.5.2 constructor
that pre-sizes `slots` from the resolver's hint, avoiding a grow on
every `DefineAt` in hot loops. `NewEnvironment(parent)` (no size)
is still used by REPL paths and by ad-hoc paths where the slot
count isn't known upfront.

`execBlock` opens a fresh child `Environment` for each `{...}` block, so
variables declared inside don't leak out. `for` opens its own scope wrapping
init/cond/step/body so the init variable is visible throughout the loop
without escaping it.

### Resolver / runtime scope alignment (M16.5.2)

The resolver's static scope stack has to match the runtime's env
chain exactly, or `(Depth, Slot)` addresses land in the wrong place.
Three carve-outs where the resolver deviates from "one AST scope =
one runtime frame":

- **`try` body runs in the enclosing env**, not a fresh frame:
  `execTry` calls `execStmts(body.Stmts, env)` directly. The resolver
  walks try-body statements inline in the current scope to match.
  Only the catch handler gets a proper scope push (matches the
  runtime's `catchEnv := NewEnvironment(env)`).
- **For-header init lives in `forEnv`**, body lives in a nested
  block frame: `execFor` creates one env for the header and
  `execBlock` nests another for the body. The resolver tracks them
  as separate scopes.
- **Spawn bodies are deliberately unresolved.** The runtime's
  `snapshotForSpawn` produces a two-frame duplex (globals-snap +
  locals-snap) that doesn't align with the resolver's single-frame
  view of "the enclosing scope." Rather than invent depth arithmetic
  to reconcile the two, the resolver skips spawn-body statements
  entirely and every reference inside falls back to name-based
  lookup at runtime. Spawn is coarse-grained concurrency dispatch,
  not hot-loop territory, so the perf regression is bounded.

### Method call frames (M16.5.3)

Three compounded moves cut the recursive-call cost:

- **Environment pool.** `environment.go` exports `borrowBlockEnv` /
  `releaseBlockEnv` on top of a package-level `sync.Pool`. Every
  `execBlock`, every `evalCall`, and every `CallByName` borrows a
  frame on entry and returns it before returning to the caller.
  Release zeroes both the `vars` map (delete-in-place) and every
  used slot entry so the pool doesn't retain compound-value
  backings live between uses. Jennifer has no closures - no value,
  no library, no AST node can capture an env pointer past its
  block's dynamic extent - so the pool is safe by construction.
  The two envs that outlive their creating call (`i.global`, the
  goroutine-root snapshots from `snapshotForSpawn`) stay on the
  non-pooled `NewEnvironment` path.
- **Pre-resolved callees.** `CallExpr` carries a `Method
  *MethodDef` pointer (see `internal/parser/ast.go`). During
  `Resolve` the resolver stamps the pointer when the callee names
  a hoisted top-level user method. `evalCall` consults the pointer
  first; only when it's `nil` (REPL turns, hand-built ASTs) does
  it fall back to `i.methods[c.Callee]`. Builtins keep the
  pointer `nil` because the namespaced / global registries still
  need the `use`-activation check on every call.
- **Slot-based parameter binding.** The resolver's `resolveMethod`
  assigns parameters to slots `0..N-1` in the call frame. At
  runtime `evalCall` borrows the call frame via
  `borrowBlockEnv(effectiveGlobal(env), len(m.Params))` and binds
  each parameter through `DefineAt(idx, ...)`. No map hashing per
  parameter; the resolver's slot numbers align with the
  interpreter's storage layout automatically.

## Execution model

1. `Interpreter.Run(prog)` calls `parser.Resolve(prog)` first (M16.5.2)
   so the AST carries `(Depth, Slot)` annotations before any structural
   check runs. Resolve is idempotent: re-running on an already-resolved
   program produces the same annotations. Any undefined-variable or
   shadowing error surfaces here as a positioned parse-time
   diagnostic, not a runtime error.
2. Records `Imports` into `i.imported`.
3. Collects every `MethodDef` into `i.methods` (methods are hoisted: callable
   regardless of source order). During collection it enforces two rules:
   no duplicate method names, and no method name that collides with a
   registered builtin whose owning library has been imported (the no-shadowing
   rule extended to builtins - see `evalCall` below).
4. Creates the global `Environment` (`i.global`) and executes `prog.TopLevel`
   statements in source order in that global scope.
5. Method calls execute the body in a fresh call frame whose parent is
   `effectiveGlobal(env)` (walks to the outermost ancestor - `i.global`
   in serial code, the spawn-globals snapshot inside a `spawn` body).
   M16.5.3: the call frame is borrowed from the environment pool
   pre-sized to the parameter count; parameters bind through
   `DefineAt` into slots `0..N-1`; the callee is looked up via the
   pre-resolved `CallExpr.Method` pointer when set, falling back to
   `i.methods` when it isn't (REPL turns). Top-level variables are
   visible inside methods (subject to the no-shadowing rule). The
   body's return value (bare `return;` -> `null`; `return EXPR;` ->
   the expression's value; falling off the end -> `null`) propagates
   back to the caller.

`EvalInteractive` (the REPL entry point) skips step 1 - each REPL turn
is a fresh parse whose scope can't be resolved without the accumulated
global context from prior turns. The runtime handles this by leaving
resolver annotations at their `-1` sentinel and using the name-based
Environment API. The perf cost is limited to REPL sessions, which
aren't hot loops.

There is no required entry point. A program with only imports and method
defs is valid and runs to completion immediately (those methods are simply
never called).

## Builtins and libraries

Each library lives in its own Go package under `internal/lib/<name>/` and
registers its functions (and constants) on the interpreter. User-facing
reference docs are split per library:

- [libraries/io.md](../libraries/io.md) - `printf`, `sprintf`, format verbs
- [libraries/convert.md](../libraries/convert.md) - `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `typeOf`
- [libraries/math.md](../libraries/math.md) - `math.abs`, `min`, `max`, `sqrt`, `pow`, `floor`, `ceil`, `round`, `rand`, `randInt`, `randSeed`; constants `math.PI`, `math.E`
- [libraries/strings.md](../libraries/strings.md) - `upper`, `lower`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `indexOf`, `trim`/`trimLeft`/`trimRight`, `replace`, `repeat`, `substring`, `split`, `chars`, `join`
- [libraries/os.md](../libraries/os.md) - `os.PLATFORM`, `os.ARCH`, `os.EOL`, `os.DIRSEP`, `os.PATHSEP`, `os.ARGS`, `os.getEnv`, `os.hasFlag`, `os.flag`, `os.run`, `os.spawn`, `os.wait`, `os.poll`, `os.kill`
- [libraries/meta.md](../libraries/meta.md) - `meta.VERSION` (build version), `meta.BUILD` (toolchain)
- [libraries/index.md](../libraries/index.md) - catalog and organizing principles
- `len(EXPR)` is a language built-in primary (M15.4+), not a library function. See [grammar.md](grammar.md).

What follows is the implementation contract, not the user-facing API.

Library functions are Go closures registered with the interpreter:

```go
type BuiltinCtx struct {
    Out    io.Writer  // stdout-like effects write here
    In     io.Reader  // stdin-consuming builtins read here
    InREPL bool       // true when the call originates from the REPL
}
type Builtin func(ctx BuiltinCtx, args []Value) (Value, error)

# In a library package:
func Install(in *interpreter.Interpreter) {
    in.Register("io", "printf", printf)
    in.Register("io", "sprintf", sprintf)
    in.Register("io", "readLine", readLine)
    in.Register("io", "eof", eofFn)
}
```

`BuiltinCtx` replaces an earlier `(out io.Writer, args)` signature at
M7 to give input-consuming builtins symmetric access to stdin and the
REPL flag. `Interpreter.In` defaults to `os.Stdin`; the REPL sets
`Interpreter.InREPL = true` so `readLine` / `eof` refuse rather than
racing the line editor for input.

`Interpreter.Builtins` stores `builtinEntry{Lib, Fn}` per name. A call to
`foo(...)` resolves in this order:

1. User-defined method `foo` in `i.methods`.
2. Builtin `foo` - **but only if its owning library has been `use`d**. The
   error otherwise quotes the right library name: `` `foo` requires `use <lib>;` ``.

The no-shadowing check at hoist time uses the same lookup: a user method
that collides with an imported library's builtin is rejected.

User-defined **constants** (via `def const NAME as TYPE init EXPR;`)
live in the same Environment as variables and resolve through
`evalExpr`'s `ConstRefExpr` case (bare-identifier lookup). They
participate in the no-shadowing rule like everything else.

Library-provided constants (`math.PI`, `math.E`, `time.UTC`,
`time.PROGRAM_START`, `os.PLATFORM`, ...) are namespaced and
registered through `RegisterNamespacedConst`. They resolve
through `QualifiedConstRefExpr` - see the "Namespaced libraries"
subsection below. The pre-M10 `RegisterConst` flat-namespace
constant API and the bare-IDENT `ConstRefExpr` fallback for
library constants are no longer used by any shipping library; the
fallback path remains in the interpreter as exported API surface
pending a final cleanup pass.

### Namespaced libraries

Domain libraries register through the namespaced API:

```go
in.RegisterNamespaced("os", "platform", platformFn)
in.RegisterNamespacedConst("os", "JENNIFER_OS", interpreter.StringVal("linux"))
```

Both entries are keyed by `(namespace, name)` in `NSBuiltins` /
`NSConstants`. The library's name doubles as the namespace prefix
(future libraries may decouple them, but today they always match).
Registering through the namespaced API also flags the lib in
`knownNamespaces`.

**Only libraries flagged in `knownNamespaces` may be aliased.**
`processImports` rejects `use NAME as ALIAS;` for any library that
registered exclusively through `Register` / `RegisterConst` (the
flat API) with the message `library NAME has no namespaced
builtins; ` + "`as ALIAS`" + ` aliasing is meaningless here`. The
flat libraries (`io`, `convert`, `math`, `strings`, `core`) all
fall into this category - they have no prefix to rename, and
silently accepting an `as` clause would create the misleading
impression of an alias-shaped escape hatch.

`processImports` builds two maps from each `use NAME [as ALIAS];`:

- `nsPrefixes[prefix] = canonicalNamespace` - the prefix that's
  active at call sites; `prefix == canonical` for `use os;`,
  `prefix == alias` for `use os as o;`.
- `nsAliasedAway[canonical] = alias` - records that the canonical
  name has been shadowed by an alias, so a later `os.foo()` after
  `use os as o;` errors with a `did you mean ` + "`o`" + `?` hint.

Resolution at a `QualifiedCallExpr` / `QualifiedConstRefExpr` goes
through `resolveNamespacePrefix(prefix)`:

1. If `prefix` is in `nsPrefixes`, use the canonical namespace it
   points at.
2. Else, if `prefix` is in `nsAliasedAway`, emit the "did you mean
   `<alias>`?" hint.
3. Else, if `prefix` is the canonical name of a *known* namespaced
   lib the program forgot to `use`, emit a `requires ` + "`use prefix;`"
   reminder.
4. Else, emit `unknown namespace`.

The no-shadowing rule for top-level methods (`checkMethodNoShadow`)
adds one more clause: a method name that matches an active namespace
prefix is rejected (`func os() {}` errors after `use os;`, but is
fine after `use os as o;` because only `o` is reserved as a prefix).

The five essential flat libraries (`io`, `convert`, `math`,
`strings`, `core`) intentionally do *not* use the namespaced API -
their names stay bare for ergonomics.

For the user-facing API of each library, follow the links above. Below are
the implementation-only notes worth knowing as a maintainer.

**`internal/lib/io`**: `printf` and `sprintf` share a `formatArgs` helper
with three shapes - 0 args errors; first-arg-is-string triggers format
substitution; single non-string arg writes the value's `Display()` form
(the "just print this value" shortcut). `printf` writes to
`Interpreter.Out`; `sprintf` returns a `KindString` value and ignores
the writer.

**`internal/lib/math`**: `floor`/`ceil`/`round` accept int (identity) or
float and return `int`. `round` uses Go's `math.Round` (half away from
zero). `math.PI` and `math.E` are registered via
`RegisterNamespacedConst` and resolved through `QualifiedConstRefExpr`
like every other namespaced constant (M10+); the namespace prefix is
reserved for the rest of the program once `use math;` runs.

**`internal/lib/convert`**: parser side - the `typeCall` production lets
`int(...)`, `float(...)`, `string(...)`, `bool(...)` parse despite their
names being type keywords. `typeOf` is a normal IDENT call. `bool(v)`
implements canonical-only conversion at all source kinds (`0`/`1` for int,
`0.0`/`1.0` for float, `"true"`/`"false"` for string) - non-canonical
values produce a positioned error, not silent coercion.

**`internal/lib/strings`**: all indices and lengths are **rune-based**
(Unicode code points), implemented via `unicode/utf8`. `len` returns the
rune count; `indexOf` returns a rune index (not the byte index Go's
`strings.Index` produces - we translate); `substring` uses a small
`byteOffsetForRune` helper to convert rune-indexed bounds back to byte
slicing on the underlying string. `repeat` guards against multiplication
overflow before calling Go's `strings.Repeat` to avoid the panic in the
standard library. The Go package is named `stringslib` to avoid colliding
with the standard `strings` package, which it depends on heavily.

## Runtime errors

`*runtimeError` carries optional `File`/`Line`/`Col` and a `Kind` tag
(M13.2; defaults to `"runtime"` when the originating site doesn't
specialise it). Errors render as `runtime error at FILE:L:C: <msg>`
(or `runtime error at L:C: <msg>` when the file is unknown). All
five Jennifer error types - `*lexer.LexError`, `*preproc.PreprocessError`,
`*parser.ParseError`, `*runtimeError`, and `*ErrorSignal` (M13.2) -
implement a small `Position() (file string, line, col int)` interface.
The CLI uses that interface (no string parsing) to look up the right
file and print a caret under the offending source line.

### Catchable errors (M13.2)

`try { body } catch (NAME) { handler }` runs the body and, on an
error, binds the thrown value to `$NAME` in a fresh per-handler
scope. Two sentinel paths can produce the catchable error:

- **`*ErrorSignal`** - raised by `throw EXPR;` (`execThrow`). Carries
  the thrown `Value` plus the throw's source position. Uncaught
  signals reach the CLI through the same `positioned` interface as
  `*runtimeError`.
- **`*runtimeError`** - raised by any builtin or language operation
  (out-of-bounds index, missing map key, type mismatch, etc.). When
  one reaches an enclosing `try`, `execTry` wraps it via
  `runtimeErrorToValue` into an `Error` struct (`kind`, `message`,
  `file`, `line`, `col`) and binds it like any other thrown value.

`*ExitSignal` is **not** routed through this path - the spec puts
process exit outside the recoverable-error scope, so `execTry`
propagates it untouched. `blockResult` flags (`hasReturn`,
`hasBreak`, `hasContinue`) flow through `execTry` unchanged so the
surrounding method / loop sees them.

The canonical `Error` struct is auto-hoisted into `i.structs` by
both `Run` and `EvalInteractive` before any user struct definition
runs (`canonicalErrorStructDef()`). User code may not redefine it -
the existing duplicate-struct check fires with
`struct "Error" is defined more than once`.

`runtimeError.Kind` is the symbolic tag surfaced as `$err.kind` in
the catch block. The current shipping default is `"runtime"`;
specific tags (`"out_of_bounds"`, `"type_mismatch"`, etc.) get
filled in per call site as user code grows demand for finer
dispatch.

## Errors and positions (cross-file)

The pipeline plumbs file information through three layers:

1. The lexer attaches the source file path to every token (`Token.File`).
   `TokenizeWithFile(source, file)` is the entry point; the no-arg
   `Tokenize` leaves `File` blank for unattributed input.
2. The preprocessor preserves each spliced token's `File` field when
   resolving `import "path.j";`, so tokens from an imported file keep that
   file's path, line, and column.
3. The parser propagates `File` from tokens to every AST node (each
   `pos` struct carries `File`, `Line`, `Col`). Synthesized nodes (e.g.
   `BinaryExpr`) copy the file from the left operand.

When the interpreter raises a `*runtimeError`, it pulls file/line/col from
the offending node via a small `posFor(node)` helper. The CLI's
`printErrorContext` type-asserts the `positioned` interface, and if the
reported file differs from the program's main file it loads that file from
disk before slicing out the snippet to display.

## Concurrency (M16.0)

M16.0 ships the `spawn` keyword, the `task of T` type kind, and
the `task` library. Together they form Jennifer's first
concurrency surface. The user-facing model is
[docs/user-guide/concurrency.md](../user-guide/concurrency.md);
this section describes the runtime side.

### Goroutine mapping

`spawn { ... }` is a primary expression: `parser.SpawnExpr`
carries the body as `[]Stmt`. The interpreter handles it through
`evalSpawn`:

1. Build a fresh capture environment with `snapshotForSpawn(env)`.
2. Allocate a `TaskState` with a freshly made `Done chan struct{}`.
3. Register the state in the interpreter's per-run task registry.
4. `go i.runSpawn(state, ex, spawnEnv)`.
5. Return a `Value` of kind `KindTask` wrapping the state pointer.

`runSpawn` closes `state.Done` from a `defer` so all observers
(`task.wait`, `task.waitAll`, `task.waitAny`, the exit-time scan)
see the close as a happens-before edge before reading `state.Result`
or `state.Err`. The goroutine itself executes the body via the
existing `execBlock` over the captured env; this is the same path
top-level statements take, so the spawn body sees the full
interpreter (libraries, structs, method definitions, namespacing).

`return EXPR;` in the body becomes `state.Result`. A `blockResult`
with `hasReturn=false` but no error means an implicit `null` return
(matches method-call semantics). `break` or `continue` that
escapes its loop inside the body becomes a positioned error
("`break` outside a loop" / "`continue` outside a loop") via
`unhandledLoopFlowError`; loop-flow can't cross the spawn
boundary, mirroring how it can't cross a method-call boundary.

### Value-semantics capture

`snapshotForSpawn(env)` is the data-race story. It builds a
two-frame chain: a "globals" frame holding deep copies of every
`i.global` binding, and a "locals" frame chained on top holding
deep copies of every non-global binding visible at the spawn
site. The spawn body runs against the locals frame; user-method
call frames inside the spawn parent through `effectiveGlobal` and
land on the globals frame.

```go
func (i *Interpreter) snapshotForSpawn(env *Environment) *Environment {
    globalSnap := NewEnvironment(nil)
    for name, b := range i.global.vars {
        globalSnap.vars[name] = b.deepCopy() // globals -> own frame
    }
    localSnap := NewEnvironment(globalSnap)
    for cur := env; cur != nil && cur != i.global; cur = cur.parent {
        for name, b := range cur.vars {
            if _, seen := localSnap.vars[name]; seen { continue }
            localSnap.vars[name] = b.deepCopy()
        }
    }
    return localSnap
}
```

The two-frame shape is what lets user-function calls inside the
spawn keep their normal scoping. A user method's call frame
inherits from the *global* surface only - never from the
caller's locals (Jennifer's "no inheriting caller scope" model).
Inside a spawn, the call frame's parent comes from
`effectiveGlobal(env)`:

```go
func effectiveGlobal(env *Environment) *Environment {
    cur := env
    for cur != nil && cur.parent != nil {
        cur = cur.parent
    }
    return cur
}
```

In serial code `env` chains to `i.global`, so `effectiveGlobal`
returns `i.global`. In a spawn body `env` chains to the snapshot's
globals frame, so `effectiveGlobal` returns that frame. Both paths
honour the no-shadowing rule the same way (parameters never
collide with captured locals, only with true globals), and the
spawn body's user-method calls are race-free because they never
touch the live `i.global` the parent goroutine may be writing.

Deep-copy reuses the same `Value.Copy()` path as `$ys = $xs;` and
function-parameter binding, so lists, maps, bytes, and structs
copy at any depth.

The one exception is `KindTask` itself. A `task of T` value
deliberately copies the *pointer* to the underlying `TaskState`,
not the state - multiple variables pointing at "the same spawn"
must observe it together. Without this, `def u as task of T init $t;`
would clone the in-flight goroutine handle and break observation
counting.

### Task registry and loud-fail

The interpreter carries

```go
type Interpreter struct {
    // ...
    tasksMu sync.Mutex
    tasks   []*TaskState
}
```

`evalSpawn` calls `registerTask(state)`. Each `TaskState` carries
an `Observed bool` flag that any of the three "I saw this"
operations flips: `task.wait` (both on success return and on
rethrow), `task.discard`, and `task.waitAll` (drains every
survivor before re-raising).

`Interpreter.UnwaitedTaskErrors()` runs at the end of CLI
execution:

```go
func (i *Interpreter) UnwaitedTaskErrors() []error {
    i.tasksMu.Lock()
    snapshot := append([]*TaskState(nil), i.tasks...)
    i.tasksMu.Unlock()
    var errs []error
    for _, t := range snapshot {
        if t == nil || t.Observed { continue }
        <-t.Done                       // happens-before edge
        if t.Err != nil { errs = append(errs, t.Err) }
    }
    return errs
}
```

It deliberately blocks on `<-t.Done` for every unobserved task.
The "no footguns" rationale: a non-blocking scan could miss a
late-arriving error and silently exit cleanly. Blocking buys the
loud-fail guarantee at the cost of hanging the program when an
unobserved goroutine never finishes (a `spawn { while (true) {} }`
without `task.discard`). The user-guide flags this as a footgun
of its own; the runtime trade-off favours soundness.

`cmd/jennifer/main.go` consumes the slice: after `Run(prog)`
returns, it walks `UnwaitedTaskErrors()`, prints each one to
stderr in `spawn error (unwaited): MSG` form, and bumps the
process exit code if any were present. `ExitSignal` from a body
is special-cased in the loud-fail surface (treat as a normal
program-level exit, not a "task error") so user-explicit
shutdowns don't print spurious "unwaited" lines.

### task library Go layer

`internal/lib/task` registers five namespaced builtins through
the standard `RegisterNamespaced` path:

| Builtin            | Path                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task.wait`        | block on `<-state.Done`; `MarkObserved`; return `Result` or wrap `Err` as runtimeError        |
| `task.poll`        | `BoolVal(state.IsDone())` via the non-blocking select on `state.Done`                         |
| `task.discard`     | `MarkObserved`; return `Null()` immediately (does not block)                                  |
| `task.waitAll`     | iterate list, wait each, mark all observed; return list-of-results or first error in order    |
| `task.waitAny`     | `[]reflect.SelectCase` over the list, `reflect.Select`, return chosen index                   |

`reflect.Select` is the one place the runtime drops into reflect;
acceptable because the list length is dynamic and `select { ... }`
on a variable arm count has no other Go-level construction. The
TinyGo target supports it for chan-receive cases; verified by the
package tests passing under both compilers.

`MarkObserved` is a thin wrapper around setting the flag under
the registry mutex (no atomics - the field is read only by the
exit-time scan, which already takes the mutex). The pattern is
"observation = explicit consent that this task's outcome is
yours"; the loud-fail path is the only place reads happen
outside the consenting frame.

### Type stamping for `task of T`

`parser.TypeTask` joins `TypeList` / `TypeMap` / `TypeBytes` /
`TypeStruct` in the `Type.Kind` enum. `Type.Element` holds the
`T` for `task of T`; `Type.String` and `Type.Equal` handle
recursion the same way as `list of T`. `MatchesDeclared` rejects
non-task values and (when the declared element type is concrete)
walks the wrapped task's `ElemTyp` to enforce element-type
compatibility - so `def t as task of int init spawn { return "x"; };`
fails at the use site, not deep inside the spawn body.

### CLI integration

`main.go` (batch path), `repl.go` (interactive path),
`fmt_test.go::runProgramOutput` (golden-test harness), and
`examples_test.go` all `tasklib.Install(in)` alongside the other
libraries. The REPL path also calls `UnwaitedTaskErrors()` between
inputs - a spawn that errored in line N surfaces before the prompt
for line N+1, so the REPL session can't accumulate silent failures.

### What's deferred

The runtime side has more breathing room than the user-facing
surface. The deferred pieces:

- **Channels.** No `chan T` type, no `send`/`recv` builtins. The
  spawn/task pair handles the common cases; a channel primitive
  would add real bookkeeping and is a later M16.x candidate.
- **Cancellation.** No way for an outsider to stop a running
  spawn body. Open design question (cooperative vs hard abort vs
  structured-concurrency tree).
- **Structured concurrency.** No automatic scope-bounded
  termination. The loud-fail registry is the lighter-weight answer.
- **Timeouts.** Compose with a `time.sleep` sentinel + `task.waitAny`;
  a higher-level helper may ship later.
- **Refcounted copy-on-write for `Value`.** The O(N) deep-copy
  cost of spawning over a large captured collection is a known
  cost of the value-semantics model and the same cost that hits
  `$ys = $xs;` in serial code. A refcounted copy-on-mutation
  optimisation in the `Value` runtime would help both paths; not
  scheduled.
