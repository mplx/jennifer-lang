- Verifies the `.j` extension
- Reads the file, parses, runs
- On error: prints the message and a source-context caret on stderr, exits `1`
- Bad usage exits `2`
- `jennifer help` includes a `Version:` line so the build is identifiable at a glance

## REPL (`cmd/jennifer/repl.go`)

The REPL drives a read-eval-print loop on top of the standard pipeline. Each
input is lexed, preprocessed, parsed, and fed to `Interpreter.EvalInteractive`
(not `Run`). `EvalInteractive` differs from `Run` in three documented ways:
the global env is lazy-initialized and preserved across calls, library
imports and method definitions are idempotent / re-assignable so the user
can iterate, and the value of a trailing `ExprStmt` is returned so the loop
can print it.

Multi-line input is handled by a small `inputComplete(tokens)` helper that
balances `{`/`(` against `}`/`)` (using the lexer's tokens so string and
comment contents are ignored) and requires the input to end in `;` or `}`.
Anything else triggers a `... ` continuation prompt. Unbalanced *closing*
delimiters intentionally fall through to the parser for diagnosis since no
amount of additional input would fix them.

REPL input is tagged with the synthetic file label `<repl>`. The
cross-file-error snippet loader in `printErrorContext` treats `<repl>` like
`<stdin>`: no external file lookup is attempted, and the current input
buffer is used as the snippet source. Lex errors discard the buffer (since
they cannot become valid by reading more); parse and runtime errors print
and the loop continues.

`:quit` / `:exit` / EOF terminate cleanly; `:help` prints a short reminder.
Directives are only recognized at a fresh prompt so a literal `:quit` inside
a block doesn't short-circuit.

### Line editor (`cmd/jennifer/lineedit.go`, `cmd/jennifer/history.go`)

When stdin is a terminal the REPL installs raw mode via
`golang.org/x/term` and reads lines through a small built-in editor.
The editor is a single state machine over a rune buffer plus a cursor
index; each keystroke updates the state and triggers a `redraw()`.

Supported input:

| Key                          | Action                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Printable rune               | Insert at cursor                                                             |
| Backspace, Ctrl+H            | Delete char before cursor                                                    |
| Delete (CSI `3~`)            | Delete char at cursor                                                        |
| Left / Right (CSI `D` / `C`) | Move cursor by one char                                                      |
| Home / End (CSI `H` / `F`)   | Jump to line start / end                                                     |
| Ctrl+A / Ctrl+E              | Same as Home / End                                                           |
| Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right       | Move by word                                                                 |
| Alt+B / Alt+F                | Same as Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right (macOS terminals send these for option-arrow) |
| Ctrl+W, Ctrl+Backspace       | Delete word backward                                                         |
| Ctrl+U                       | Kill from line start to cursor                                               |
| Ctrl+K                       | Kill from cursor to line end                                                 |
| Up / Down                    | History navigation                                                           |
| Ctrl+C                       | Cancel current line (fresh prompt)                                           |
| Ctrl+D on empty buffer       | EOF (exits the REPL)                                                         |
| Ctrl+D on non-empty buffer   | Forward-delete                                                               |

Word boundaries use a small punctuation + whitespace ruleset that's
predictable for source-code editing without needing a full Unicode
word-break implementation. History is an in-memory ring (`replHistory`,
100 entries by default, adjacent duplicates collapsed); on-disk
persistence is a future enhancement.

Non-TTY stdin falls back to the original `bufio` line reader. This
keeps `echo ... | jennifer repl` and integration tests working
unchanged - the editor would do nothing useful on a non-interactive
stream anyway.

Raw mode disables the kernel's `OPOST` flag, so `\n` written to stdout
no longer auto-translates to `\r\n`. The REPL works around this with
a tiny `crlfWriter` wrapper that performs the translation in user
space for error/help/result prints. Cooked-mode output (the banner
printed before raw mode is entered, and anything after raw mode is
restored) goes to `os.Stderr` / `os.Stdout` directly.

The editor only handles single-line editing. Multi-line input via the
continuation prompt (`... `) is still driven by the surrounding REPL
loop's `inputComplete()` check, so unclosed `{` / `(` accumulate
across calls to `editor.readLine`.

## Inspection: `tokens` and `ast`

`cmd/jennifer/dump.go` and `cmd/jennifer/astjson.go` implement two
read-only inspection subcommands. `tokens` runs only the lexer and
prints one token per line in column-aligned `LINE:COL TYPE [lexeme]`
form - useful for tracing scanning issues and as a teaching tool.
`ast` runs lex + preproc + parse and writes the resulting AST as
two-space-indented JSON; every node carries `type`, `file`, `line`,
`col`, plus its node-specific fields.

The JSON emitter is hand-rolled in `astjson.go`'s `emitNode` (a switch
over every concrete AST type). We avoid `encoding/json` because its
reflect-based marshaling is fragile under TinyGo and at odds with the
tagged-union `Value` discipline used elsewhere; a switch over ~20 node
kinds is small enough to keep readable. Each field-emitter
(`emitStringField`, `emitBoolField`, `emitNodeListField`, etc.) writes
`"key": value,` and the closing `endObj` trims the trailing comma so
the output is valid JSON.

## Formatter (`cmd/jennifer/fmt.go`)

`jennifer fmt` formats source per [../user-guide/style-guide.md](../user-guide/style-guide.md).
It operates on the lexer's token stream rather than the AST, for two
reasons:

1. **`import "file.j";` survives.** The preprocessor consumes file
   imports before the parser sees them; an AST-based formatter would
   inline every import, which is the opposite of what a developer
   wants from `fmt`. The token-level formatter sees IMPORT tokens
   unchanged and re-emits them.
2. **User-written parens survive.** The AST records grouping only
   through nesting structure; redundant parens are erased. A token
   walker preserves LPAREN/RPAREN exactly as written, so
   `($a + $b) * $c` stays parenthesized after a round trip.

`formatTokens(tokens)` drives a small state machine (`fmtState`): for
each token it computes the separator (`writeSeparator`) - none, a
space, or a newline-plus-indent - and then writes the token's canonical
spelling (`writeToken`). Key state fields:

- `indent` bumps on `{` and drops on `}` (the closing brace dedents
  *before* it's written so it lands at the outer indent).
- `prevIsOperand` answers "is the next `-` binary or unary?" - flipped
  by `isOperandToken` after every emit.
- `prevIsUnaryMinus` suppresses the right-side space after a `-` that
  was determined to be unary.
- `insideForHeader` is a small backward scan that lets the two `;`s
  inside `for (...; ...; ...)` stay on the same line.

Strings are re-quoted with `quoteJenniferString` (double quotes plus
standard escapes), mirroring the lexer's `readString` on the way in.

Comments and blank lines survive a `fmt` round-trip: the lexer
emits them as trivia tokens, and `emitTrivia` writes them inline
without disturbing the surrounding state machine. Leading
comments land on their own line at the current indent; trailing
same-line comments stay on the same line; runs of blank lines
collapse to one. Block comments may nest.

## Version injection

`internal/version.Version` holds the build version as a single `string`.
The default is `"dev"`; the `Makefile` runs `scripts/gen-version.sh` before
each build, which writes `internal/version/version_gen.go` containing a
small `init()` that overwrites `Version` with the output of
`scripts/version.sh` (a `git describe --tags --long` derivative; see
[../libraries/meta.md](../libraries/meta.md) for the format).

This codegen path replaces the more conventional `go build -ldflags
"-X .Version=..."` because TinyGo 0.41 silently ignores the `-X`
directive. Codegen works identically on both toolchains. The generated
file is `.gitignore`d so the repository never carries a stale copy.

Two consumers read `version.Version`:

- `cmd/jennifer/main.go` prints it in the `help` banner and as the body
  of the `version` subcommand.
- `internal/lib/meta/metalib.go` mirrors it into the interpreter as the
  `meta.VERSION` constant. The `meta` library is opt-in like every
  other library: `use meta; io.printf("%s\n", meta.VERSION);`.

`go test ./...` skips codegen and uses the default `"dev"`. The meta-lib
test only checks that the constant matches `version.Version`, not a
specific value, so it stays robust across builds.
