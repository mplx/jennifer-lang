# Jennifer

Jennifer is a small, experimental, interpreted programming language
written in (Tiny)Go and ships as two binaries:

- **`jennifer`** - standard Go build, full host-feature surface.
  This is the default binary you install and reach for.
- **`jennifer-tiny`** - TinyGo build, smaller and embeddable.
  Missing `os/exec` and the network stack (TinyGo runtime gaps);
  calls into those surfaces return a friendly runtime error
  pointing back at `jennifer`. Use this variant when binary size
  or embeddability matters (embedded systems, minimal containers,
  small-footprint scripting hosts).

Source files use the `.j` extension. Whitespace is not significant
anywhere; statements end with `;`.

```jennifer
use io;
use time;

def start as time.Time init time.now();
io.printf("hello, world\n");
def gap as time.Duration init time.sub(time.now(), $start);
io.printf("ran for %d ms\n", time.milliseconds($gap));
```

## What's in this site

- **[Getting started](user-guide/installing.md)** - install the
  interpreter and run your first program.
- **[Language reference](user-guide/index.md)** - syntax, types,
  methods, control flow, imports, style.
- **[Libraries](libraries/index.md)** - per-library reference plus
  an alphabetical [cheatsheet](libraries/cheatsheet.md) of every
  builtin.
- **[Technical reference](technical/index.md)** - implementation
  details for the lexer, parser, interpreter, and CLI.
- **[Project](milestones.md)** - milestones, design stances,
  glossary.

## Status

Pre-1.0. The major version stays at `0.x.y` while the language is
still finding its shape; breaking changes can happen at milestone
boundaries and are called out in
[docs/milestones.md](milestones.md). Once Jennifer reaches `1.0.0`,
semver applies and breaking changes need a major bump.
