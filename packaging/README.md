# Packaging

Distribution-specific metadata for Jennifer. Each distro gets its
own subdirectory; shared assets (man pages, MIME definitions) live
at this level.

```
packaging/
  README.md             - this file
  debian/               - .deb control files (control, copyright, postinst, postrm)
  arch/                 - AUR PKGBUILDs (-bin downloads release, -git builds from source)
  mime/jennifer.xml     - XDG shared-mime-info; both .deb and AUR install it
  man/jennifer.1        - man page for the TinyGo binary
  man/jennifer-go.1     - man page for the standard-Go binary
```

The actual `.deb` is built by `scripts/build-deb.sh` (invoked
by `.github/workflows/release.yml`) and attached to the GitHub
Release. AUR packages are published manually after each tagged
release (the PKGBUILDs in `arch/` are the canonical source).

## Adding a new distro

Add a subdirectory `packaging/<distro>/` with the platform-native
recipe and reference the shared assets in `mime/` and `man/` so
the MIME registration and man pages stay consistent across distros.
Update the release pipeline if the build needs CI integration; the
parallel "Path to 1.0.0 distribution" track in
[../docs/milestones.md](../docs/milestones.md) lists planned future
formats (Homebrew, Snap, Nix flake).
