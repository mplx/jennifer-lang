# Packaging

Distribution-specific metadata for Jennifer. Each distro gets its
own subdirectory; shared assets (man pages, MIME definitions) live
at this level.

```
packaging/
  README.md             - this file
  debian/               - .deb control files (control, copyright, postinst, postrm)
  arch/                 - AUR PKGBUILDs (-bin downloads release, -git builds from source),
                          the shared jennifer.install hook, and publish-bin.sh /
                          publish-git.sh (copied into the AUR clones to publish)
  windows/              - Inno Setup script (jennifer.iss) + README; the CI
                          build-windows-installer job compiles it to
                          jennifer-<ver>-setup.exe (best-effort, unsupported)
  docker/               - multi-stage Dockerfile (slim + static variants) + README;
                          the CI docker workflow builds/pushes multi-arch images
                          to GHCR on each release tag
  homebrew/             - Homebrew formula (jennifer.rb, builds from source) +
                          publish.sh + README; best-effort unsupported macOS tap,
                          published like the AUR packages (manual publish.sh)
  mime/jennifer.xml       - XDG shared-mime-info; both .deb and AUR install it
  man/jennifer.1          - man page for the default (standard-Go) binary
  man/jennifer-tiny.1     - man page for the constrained (TinyGo) binary
  completions/jennifer.bash - bash completion; installed as
                            share/bash-completion/completions/jennifer,
                            with jennifer-tiny symlinked to it
```

Two more assets ship in the packages but live outside `packaging/`
(they are also used standalone): the Vim/Neovim syntax from
`editors/vim/` installs to `usr/share/vim/vimfiles/{syntax,ftdetect}/`
(on Vim's default runtimepath, so `.j` highlights with no setup), and
the root `JENNIFER.md` language reference installs to
`usr/share/doc/jennifer/`.

The actual `.deb` is built by `scripts/build-deb.sh` (invoked
by `.github/workflows/release.yml`) and attached to the GitHub
Release. AUR packages are published manually after each tagged
release (the PKGBUILDs in `arch/` are the canonical source):
copy `arch/publish-bin.sh` / `arch/publish-git.sh` into the
respective AUR clone as `publish.sh` and run it. See the AUR
step in [../RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md).

## Adding a new distro

Add a subdirectory `packaging/<distro>/` with the platform-native
recipe and reference the shared assets in `mime/`, `man/`, and
`completions/` so the MIME registration, man pages, and shell
completion stay consistent across distros.
Update the release pipeline if the build needs CI integration; the
parallel "Path to 1.0.0 distribution" track in
[../docs/milestones.md](../docs/milestones.md) lists planned future
formats (Homebrew, Snap, Nix flake).
