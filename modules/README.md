# Jennifer modules

Jennifer-coded library modules (`.j` files) live here. Unlike the Go
system libraries (`internal/lib/*`, enabled with `use NAME;`), a module is
distributable Jennifer source, brought in with `import "NAME.j" as NAME;`
once the module system (M17) ships.

Distribution packages install these to the system module directory
(`/usr/share/jennifer/modules/` by default; see `jennifer version -v`),
so `import "NAME.j";` resolves without a path. Local modules resolve with
`import "./NAME.j";`, and extra search directories are added with
`jennifer run -I DIR ...`.
