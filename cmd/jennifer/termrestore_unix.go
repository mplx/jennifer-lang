// installTermSignalRestore guards the terminal against being left in raw mode by
// a terminating signal. `defer termlib.RestoreAll()` already covers every path
// that returns through runFileHook - a normal exit, `exit`, an uncaught error, a
// panic unwind - but a signal taking its default disposition kills the process
// without running any defer, so a `.j` script that is in raw mode when the signal
// lands would leave the shell wedged (no echo, no line editing).
//
// This traps SIGINT / SIGTERM / SIGHUP for the run. On delivery:
//   - If the script caught that signal itself via os.catchSignal, the handler
//     stays out of the way: the script's cooperative poll loop owns the response,
//     and its eventual clean exit runs the RestoreAll defer. This preserves the
//     os.catchSignal contract exactly.
//   - Otherwise the signal was going to terminate the process anyway. The handler
//     restores every raw-mode terminal, then resets the signal to its default
//     disposition and re-raises it, so the process dies exactly as it would have
//     unhandled (same 128+signum status, WIFSIGNALED for the parent shell) - only
//     now with a cooked terminal. The documented "an uncaught signal keeps its
//     default disposition" guarantee therefore still holds.
//
// SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are uncatchable and deliberately not handled; a `kill -9`
// can still wedge the terminal, which no in-process mechanism can prevent.
// Returns a stop function the caller defers.
