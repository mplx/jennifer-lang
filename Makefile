# Build pipeline:
#   1. scripts/gen-version.sh writes internal/version/version_gen.go from the
#      current git state (gitignored; regenerated on every build).
#   2. The toolchain compiles the binary picking up that file via an init()
#      that sets Version.
#
# `make build` produces both binaries because Jennifer has a deliberate
# two-binary story:
#   - `jennifer`     - TinyGo build. The shipping interpreter; small binary,
#                      embeddable; some host features missing (today: no
#                      `os/exec`, so `os.run` / `os.spawn` etc. return a
#                      friendly limitation error).
#   - `jennifer-go`  - standard Go toolchain. Full host-feature surface;
#                      what you reach for during development and on any
#                      machine with the host runtime available.
#
# The `build-tinygo` and `build-go` targets each produce one of the two.
#
# We use codegen rather than `-ldflags -X` because TinyGo 0.41 silently
# ignores -X. Codegen works identically on both toolchains.
